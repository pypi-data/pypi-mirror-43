# Acoustic Modes Viewer (v0.1 alpha)

This program is a simple viewer of power spectral density of sound. 
The package provides a module and a program to trace Fourier acoustic modes and resonance frequencies of excited bodies.

## Use cases
* estimate length of an excited metal bar, guitar string, or 
* measure frequency of flute tones, 
* identify resonance frequencies and through provided sound speed the corresponding length scales of mechanical components that generate unwanted resonances (e.g. in a car as a function of speed cs)
* test 1/f noise and microphonic effects in electrical devices the program runs on.


## Features
* Analysis of sound from microphone or from a file (WAV format)
* To analyze transient signals it keeps track of maximal peaks in processed spectra 
* Saves recorded and processed data to files for further analysis
* Outputs list of peak frequencies (f) and corresponding wavelengths (l=cs/f)

### Features that will be implemented 
* Save animations of PSD response for video files (not implemented yet)

## Installation
`pip install acomod`

## Troubleshooting
* acoustic\_mode\_viewer givens core dump when running in virtual environment

When you pip install acomod in virtual environment Qt platform plugin may fail to be properly 
initialized due to incorrect configuration of LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (under linux) pointing
location of Qt libraries most likely somewhere in the system directories. If version of those is not the one
required by the PyQt5 the program will fail with

`"This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem."`, 

a message that typically is not even printed out to the terminal.

Solution: 

export LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=/path/to/venv/lib/python3.6/site-packages/PyQt5/Qt/lib:$LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH
