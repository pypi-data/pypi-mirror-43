# StegCracker
Steganography brute-force utility to uncover hidden data inside files.

## Usage
Using stegcracker is simple, pass a file to it as it's first parameter and optionally pass the path
to a wordlist of passwords to try as it's second parameter. If this is not set it will default to the
rockyou.txt password file which ships with Kali Linux or can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz).

```
$ stegcracker <file> [<wordlist>]
```

## Installation
To install the program, follow these steps:

```
$ sudo apt-get install steghide -y
$ sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paradoxis/StegCracker/master/stegcracker > /usr/local/bin/stegcracker
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/stegcracker
```

## Updating
To update the program, simply pass the `--update` argument instead of a file name.

```
$ sudo stegcracker --update
