Description: # StegCracker
        Steganography brute-force utility to uncover hidden data inside files.
        
        ## Usage
        Using stegcracker is simple, pass a file to it as it's first parameter and optionally pass the path
        to a wordlist of passwords to try as it's second parameter. If this is not set it will default to the
        rockyou.txt password file which ships with Kali Linux or can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/raw/master/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou.txt.tar.gz).
        
        ```
        $ stegcracker <file> [<wordlist>]
        ```
        
        ## Installation
        To install the program, follow these steps:
        
        ```
        $ sudo apt-get install steghide -y
        $ sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paradoxis/StegCracker/master/stegcracker > /usr/local/bin/stegcracker
        $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/stegcracker
        ```
        
        ## Updating
        To update the program, simply pass the `--update` argument instead of a file name.
        
        ```
        $ sudo stegcracker --update
