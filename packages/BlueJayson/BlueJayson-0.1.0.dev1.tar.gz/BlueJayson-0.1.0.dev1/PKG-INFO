        BlueJayson is a simple Pythonic data definition library to manage very basic data validations and serializations to and from JSON.
        
        **This project is still in development and is not yet production-ready.**
        
        ## Why another library?
        
        Other similar libraries simply do not fit my use cases. So I write another one.  
        It's also my opportunity to practice meta-programming in Python (which is very cool by the way).
