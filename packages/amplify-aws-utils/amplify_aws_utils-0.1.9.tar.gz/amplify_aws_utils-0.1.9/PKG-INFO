        About Amplify
        =============
        
        Amplify builds innovative and compelling digital educational products
        that empower teachers and students across the country. We have a long
        history as the leading innovator in K-12 education - and have been

        company in tech. While others try to shrink the learning experience into
        the technology, we use technology to expand what is possible in real
        classrooms with real students and teachers.
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        amplify\_aws\_utils requires the following to be installed:
        
        ::
        
            python >= 2.7
            python >=3.6
        
        For development, ``tox>=2.9.1`` is recommended.
        
        Building
        --------
        
        Python package can be built as follows:
        
        ``python setup.py sdist``
        
        This creates a package in ``dist`` directory.
        
        Running Tests
        -------------
        
        As mentioned above, amplify\_aws\_utils uses tox, so running ``tox``
        will automatically execute linters as well as the unit tests. You can
        also run functional and integration tests by using the -e argument.
        
        For example, ``tox -e lint,py27-unit,py27-integration`` will run the
        linters, and then the unit and integration tests in python 2.7.
        
        To see all the available options, run ``tox -l``.
        
        Deployment
        ----------
        
        Deployment is done with Travis.
        
        Package is built as described above, and is uploaded to PyPI repo using
        ``devpi-client``
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This package can be installed using ``pip``
        
        ``pip install amplify_aws_utils``
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Functions provided by this package can be imported after package has
        been installed.
