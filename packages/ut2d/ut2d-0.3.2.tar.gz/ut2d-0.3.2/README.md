# ut2d
[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/badge/pypi-0.3.x-brightgreen.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/ut2d/)

__ut2d__ (unix timestamp to datetime) is a tiny command-line utility to convert unix timestamp into human readable datetime. This tool intends to use the least amount of related packages or the complicated calculations and convertions on datetime topic, and provide a very simple interface to help you convert unix timestamp in a super quick manner.

Here is a list of all functionalities supported (details are in __Examples__ section):
- get datetime of given ut;
- get datetime of now;
- get datetime and calculate time difference from now;
- get datetime and find the given time in certain timezone;
- get datetime and find the given time (with scrapper) in certain city (any city);

If you work with unix timestamp a lot or need a tiny utility to get the time of another city that linux `date` command cannot provide, `ut2d` can hopefully make your life a little bit easier.

## Installation

prerequisite: __Python 3.6__ or above

`$ pip install ut2d`

## Examples

### get datetime of given UT
```console
$ ut2d 1547671090
Unix Timestamp: 1547671090.0
Local: Wed, Jan 16, 2019 03:38PM
GMT  : Wed, Jan 16, 2019 08:38PM
```

### get datetime of now
```console
$ ut2d now
Unix Timestamp: 1547671189.5133939
Local: Wed, Jan 16, 2019 03:39PM
GMT  : Wed, Jan 16, 2019 08:39PM
```

### get datetime and calculate time difference from now
```console
$ ut2d 1547671090 -d
Unix Timestamp: 1547671090.0
Local: Wed, Jan 16, 2019 03:38PM
GMT  : Wed, Jan 16, 2019 08:38PM
Given time is 11 mins, 5 secs ago
```

### get datetime and find the given time in certain timezone
Provide timezone with prefix "GMT" or "UTC".

```console
$ ut2d now -tz "GMT+8"
Unix Timestamp: 1550257565.5289779
Local: Fri, Feb 15, 2019 02:06PM
GMT  : Fri, Feb 15, 2019 07:06PM
ðŸ˜Ž  The given time in GMT+8 is: Sat, Feb 16, 2019 03:06AM.
```

### get datetime and find the given time in certain city
This is done by scraping the city's timezone from search engines, and calculate the datetime of the given unix timestamp of the given city.

If searching "New York"... (I'm in Boston)
```console
$ ut2d 1547671090 -d -c "New York"
Unix Timestamp: 1547671090.0
Local: Wed, Jan 16, 2019 03:38PM
GMT  : Wed, Jan 16, 2019 08:38PM
Given time is 15 mins, 42 secs ago
ðŸ˜›  I am finding your city on popular search engines! Plz wait a sec...
ðŸ˜Ž  I suppose the given time in New York is: Wed, Jan 16, 2019 03:38PM. I have 88% confidence with this result from search engines!
```

You can use `now` with the `-c` flag to get the local time of any city, and you can even use other languages. e.g. åŒ—äº¬ is Beijing, and Montreuil-JuignÃ© is a city in France.
```console
$ ut2d now -c "åŒ—äº¬"
Unix Timestamp: 1547673691.203567
Local: Wed, Jan 16, 2019 04:21PM
GMT  : Wed, Jan 16, 2019 09:21PM
ðŸ˜›  I am finding your city on popular search engines! Plz wait a sec...
ðŸ˜Ž  I suppose the given time in åŒ—äº¬ is: Thu, Jan 17, 2019 05:21AM. I have 88% confidence with this result from search engines!

$ ut2d now -c "Montreuil-JuignÃ©"
Unix Timestamp: 1547673563.7226071
Local: Wed, Jan 16, 2019 04:19PM
GMT  : Wed, Jan 16, 2019 09:19PM
ðŸ˜›  I am finding your city on popular search engines! Plz wait a sec...
ðŸ˜Ž  I suppose the given time in Montreuil-JuignÃ© is: Wed, Jan 16, 2019 10:19PM. I have 88% confidence with this result from search engines!
```

You can search anything here! But if it cannot find on the search engines it will not print out the time.
