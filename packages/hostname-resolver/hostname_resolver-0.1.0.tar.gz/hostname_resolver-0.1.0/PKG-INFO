Description: # hostname_resolver
        A bulk hostname resolver, designed to get info on a large number of internal hostnames against 
        internal TLDs.
        
        Given a list of hostnames, finds their FQDN using an inbuilt list of top level domains. 
        Designed for environments where user needs full names of internal servers, but has only 
        hostnames.
        
        In addition, provides limited formatting and reporting functionality (simple text or csv)
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        pip install  
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        import hostname_resolver
        resolver = hostname_resolver.HostnameResolver()
        resolver.run()
        ```
        
        or:
        ```
        python ./hostname_resolver/__init__.py
        ```
        
        On default runs, hostname_resolver will prompt you for hostnames (recommend copy/pasting a column)
        h_r strips any duplicates and attempts to resolve hostnames as is or iterates each against its known
        TLDs. As it resolves it displays what was given, how it resolved the hostname, and the found IP.
        Once a full list is run, h_r then prompts you to run a new list, add to the previous list, build a
        report (text file or csv), or quit 
        
        ## Features
        * Adhoc functionality, most functionality modules are loaded only as needed to reduce startup time
        
        * versatility, hostnames to check can be passed through run, stdin, or the file can be called 
        directly with hostnames in as command line arguments (single items, passable arrays, or path names
        to files containing hostnames)
        
        * Modularity. It's all horizontal as heck
