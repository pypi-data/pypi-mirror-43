        ## Rationale
        
        Once upon a time, not so long ago, at a desk pretty nearby, I needed a way to read and execute Procfiles. So I embarked on a quest to find a Python module that did just that, since I didn't _want_ to roll my own:
        
        [https://pypi.org/search/?q=procfile](https://pypi.org/search/?q=procfile) returned the following top-5:
         
        * procfile 0.1.0
        * bureaucrat 0.3.6
        * honcho 1.0.1
        * heywood 0.3
        * strawboss 0.2.0
        
        and I tried each one of them. I even proposed to one of the projects to create a rather large PR to expose the functionality in an open way. None were useable in my case, requiring a Python module to access its functionality (not just a command line interfaced script) and allowing the ProcessManager to be started in a thread (so not using any form of `signal`).
        
        So there are my _good_ reasons for writing yet another Procfile module ;-)
        
        And although I couldn't use the mentioned projects as-is, I give most credit for the code in this repository to each one of them, teaching me again a lot about how to go about constructing a Python well-formed module, including testing,...
