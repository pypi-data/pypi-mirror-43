# ðŸ¤˜ Lemmy

Lemmy is a lemmatizer for Danish ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡° and Swedish ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª. It comes ready for use. The
Danish model is trained on Dansk SprognÃ¦vn's (DSN) word list (â€˜fuldformlisteâ€™) and the
[Danish Universal Dependencies](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Danish-DDT).
The Swedish model is trained on the [SALDO's
morphology](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/eng/resource/saldom) dataset and the Swedish
[Universal Dependencies
(Talbanken)](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Swedish-Talbanken). Lemmy also
supports training on your own dataset.

The models included in Lemmy were evaluated on the respective Universal Dependencies dev
datasets. The Danish model scored > 99% accuracy, while the Swedish model scored > 97%.

You can use Lemmy as a spaCy extension, more specifcally a spaCy pipeline component.
This is highly recommended and makes the lemmas easily accessible from the spaCy tokens.
Lemmy makes use of POS tags to predict the lemmas. When wired up to the spaCy pipeline,
Lemmy has the benefit of using spaCyâ€™s builtin POS tagger.

Lemmy can also by used without spaCy, as a standalone lemmatizer. In that case, you will
have to provide the POS tags. Alternatively, you can train a Lemmy model which does not
depend on POS tags, though most likely the accuracy will suffer.

Lemmy is heavily inspired by the [CST Lemmatizer for
Danish](https://cst.dk/online/lemmatiser/).

## Install

```bash
pip install lemmy
```

## Usage

```python
import da_custom_model as da # name of your spaCy model
import lemmy.pipe
nlp = da.load()

# Create an instance of Lemmy's pipeline component for spaCy.
# Replace 'da' with 'sv' for the Swedish lemmatizer.
pipe = lemmy.pipe.load('da')

# Add the comonent to the spaCy pipeline.
nlp.add_pipe(pipe, after='tagger')

# Lemmas can now be accessed using the `._.lemmas` attribute on the tokens.
nlp("akvariernes")[0]._.lemmas
```

## Training

The ``notebooks`` folder contains examples showing how to train your own model using
Lemmy.
