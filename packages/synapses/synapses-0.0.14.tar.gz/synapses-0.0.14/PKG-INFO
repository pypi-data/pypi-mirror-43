Description: 
        A PyTorch implementation of Scalable Training of Artificial Neural Networks with Adaptive Sparse Connectivity inspired by Network Science by Mocanu et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.04780)
        Uses sparse data structures. Not super fast yet, but less memory-intensive than the masked dense weight matrices used
        in the proof-of-concept code released with the paper.
