    This program takes an image that has been pre-proccessed by an edge finding script as its sole input, segments it, and spits out a segmented image file and a pandas dataframe of individual particle positions.
    
    This function works by creating a binary of an image that has been run through edge detection software, then finding the center of those particles through an Euclidean Distance function.  This was chosen over the typical watershed iterative erosion method because of its increased control in finding the center of particles, allowing for greater detection of overlapped and small particles.
