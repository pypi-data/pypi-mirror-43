"""
There are two general string-based formats of steno keys:
StenoKeys - Each character is a unique key, lowercase letters used for right-side keys.
            Used by the lexer since one key is always one character with no possible
            ambiguity over sides even if the keys are in the wrong order.
RTFCRE - Keys are all uppercase, hyphen disambiguates left vs. right side of the board.
         Center keys may also delimit the sides, in which case the hyphen is omitted.
         Most steno dictionaries (i.e. for use in Plover) are in this format.
To differentiate between these, the first can be typed as StenoKeys and the latter as just str.
Characters from an outside source (JSON files or the Plover engine) are assumed to be RTFCRE.
