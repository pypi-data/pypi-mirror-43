Description: $RLDQN
        ========
        
        An asynchronous deep Q-learning Network for training Game AI.
        
        
        Look how easy it is to use:
        ------------------------------
        
            import dqn
        
            # Runing our model to train you own AI(The model will be saved in dictionary 'logs')
            
            dqn.run_dqn.run('Game Name')
            
            # Evaluating the effect of the model
            
            dqn.run_dqn.evaluate
            
        
        
        You can see demos through download files.(Source file)
        
        We provide several demos to show how to use these module in games.
        
        And you can also see source code and demos on github.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - You do not need to know the algorithm.
        - Make things faster
        - Use the DQN to train games of yourself.
