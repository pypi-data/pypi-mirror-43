Description: ## Synopsis
        
        This python3 code does image registration. The scale, rotation and position between two images is extracted 
        
        ## Code Example
        load the module
        
        : import registrator.channel as cr
        
        Get a channel direction
        
        : an0=cr.channel_angle(im0)
        
        Get a channel width
        
        : width0=cr.channel_width(im0,chanangle=an0)
        
        Compare two images
        
        : angle, scale, origin, im2=cr.register_channel(im0,im1)
        
        ## Motivation
        
        Between series of images, the device mignt have moved, of the focal distance might have changed. 
        This project will automatically detect these differences.
