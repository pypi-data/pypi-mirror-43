Description: PSLS: the PLATO Solar-like Light-curve Simulator
        
        Simulate solar-like oscillators representative for PLATO observations.
        The simulator includes stochastically-excited oscillations, granulation and activity background components, as well as instrumental sources of noise representative for PLATO. The program also manages the existence of a time shift between groups of telescope.
        Planetary transits are included following Mandel & Agol (2002) equations (see http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...580L.171M) and using the Python implementation by Ian Crossfield (http://www.astro.ucla.edu/~ianc/>) at UCLA.
        
        Two different types of oscillation spectrum can be simulated depending of the type of star:
        * Redgiant stars: oscillation spectra based on the Universal Pattern (gen_up) together with the mixed modes patterns derived from the asymptotic theory ;
        * Main-sequence and subgiant stars: oscillation spectra based on a set of eigenfrequencies computed with ADIPLS pulsation code.
        
        Rotationnal mode splitings are implemented in a simplified manner.
        
        To install the program in your home directory for you own use, type:
           python setup.py install --home=${HOME}
        
        Edit the configuration file, an example is given in psls.yaml
        
        Finally, execute PSLS:
        	 psls.py psls.yaml
        
        To make the code working with ADIPLS, you will also need to have a grid of stellar models. We provide two grids (credit: Takafumi Sonoi):
        *  m+0y27h: stellar models with masses ranging between 0.75 and 1.15 with an initial Helium abundance Y_0=0.27 ; microscopic diffusion (no radiative accelerations) was included using the simplified equations from Michaud & Proffitt (1993). Overshoot is not included and the mixing-length parameter is fixed to 1.9
        *  m+0y24h: stellar models with masses ranging between 1.20 and 2.00 with an Helium abundance Y=0.24 ; diffusion was not included as this depletes heavy elements from the upper layers of the star, due to the neglect of radiative accelerations. An overshoot of 0.2 is assumed and the mixing-length parameter is fixed to 1.6.
        
        Note that, for RGB and clump stars, the program relies on the Universal Pattern, accordingly  stellar models are  not required for those stars.
