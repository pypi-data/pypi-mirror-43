Description: 
        # yanytapi
        
        `yanytapi` is a Python wrapper for the [New York Times Article Search API][1]. Based on the excellent [`requests`][12] package, it provides full support for all of the API's search parameters, and also allows access to the request object itself for debugging purposes.
          
        
        ## Installation
        
        With pip:
        
            $ pip install yanytapi
        
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        yanytapi requires the [`requests`][2] package.
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        Simply import and initialize the API with your developer key:
        
        ```python
        >>> from yanytapi import SearchAPI
        >>> api = SearchAPI("YourAPIKey")
        ```
        
        Then call the `search` function with your desired search parameters/values:
        
        ```python
        >>> articles = api.search("Obama", 
                                  fq={"headline": "Obama", 
                                      "source": ["Reuters", 
                                                 "AP", 
                                                 "The New York Times"]}, 
                                  begin_date="20161001", # this can also be an int
                                  facet_field=["source", "day_of_week"], 
                                  facet_filter=True)
        ```
        
        The search function returns an iterator of `Doc`'s with the following fields:
        ```json
        [
          "_id",
          "blog",
          "byline",
          "document_type",
          "headline",
          "keywords",
          "lead_paragraph",
          "meta",
          "multimedia",
          "news_desk",
          "pub_date",
          "score",
          "section_name",
          "snippet",
          "source",
          "subsectoinName",
          "type_of_material",
          "uri",
          "web_url",
          "word_count"
        ]
        ```
        
        You can specify multiple filters by using a dictionary::
        
        ```python
        >>> fq = {"headline": "Obama", "source": ["Reuters", "AP", "The New York Times"]}
        >>> articles = api.search("Obama", fq=fq)
        ```
        
        And multiple values by using a list::
        
        ```python
        >>> facet_field = ["source", "day_of_week"]
        >>> articles = api.search("Obama", facet_field=facet_field)
        ```
        
        More examples:
        
        ```python
        # simple search
        >>> articles = api.search("Obama")
        # search between specific dates
        >>> articles = api.search("Obama", begin_date="20161001", end_date="20161020", page=2)
        # access most recent request object
        >>> headers = api.req.headers
        ```
        
        For a complete overview of the available search parameters, please refer to the [NYTimes Article Search API Documentation][4].
        
        
        ## History
        
        This package was originally written by [Evan Sherlock][5] as [`nytimesarticle`][6]. It was subsequently forked and updated by [Matt Morrison][7], and subsequently released as [`NYTimesArticleAPI`][8], with contributions from [Gerald Spencer][9] and [Andrew Han][10]. `yanytapi` is a third iteration of forking focused mainly on packaging improvements, now maintained by Ed Kohlwey.
