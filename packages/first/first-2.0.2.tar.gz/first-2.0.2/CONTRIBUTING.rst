How To Contribute
=================

Although very small, “first” is always open for suggestions and contributions
by generous developers. I’ve collected a few tipps to get you started.

Please:

- Obey `PEP 8`_ and `PEP 257`_.
- *Always* add tests and docs for your code.
- Add yourself to the AUTHORS.rst_ file in an alphabetical fashion.
- Write `good commit messages`_.
- Ideally, squash_ your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just one commit.

Thank you for considering to contribute to “first”!
