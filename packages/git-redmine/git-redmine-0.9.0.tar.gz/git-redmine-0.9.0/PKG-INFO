        -----
        
        project
        .......
        
        Show the current default project.
        
        project set
        ...........
        
        Set the current default project for this repository, useful for creating new
        issues.::
        
           git redmine project set myproject-id
        
        rebase
        ......
        
        Checkout master, pull origin/master on master then rebase current feature
        branch on master, if it fails it reset the branch. Checkout the original branch
        after all this.
        
          git redmine rebase
        
        issue new
        .........
        
        Given a default project, create a new issue, an editor is launched to define
        subject and description of the issue.::
        
          git redmine issue new
        
        issue take
        ..........
        
        Handle the given issue by creating or switching to a branch named
        `wip/<issue-number>-<slugified-issue-subject>` forking from `master`.::
        
          git redmine issue take 123
        
        It will propose applying patches attached to the issue.
        
        issue show
        ..........
        
        Show information about the current issue.::
        
          git redmine issue show
        
        Show informations about issue 9999.::
        
          git redmine issue show --issue 9999
        
        issue submit
        ............
        
        It first does a `git redmine rebase` then use `git format-patch` to create the
        patch serie from `master` and attach it to the current issue. An editor is
        launched to add a commment.::
        
          git redmine issue submit
        
        To submit only the last commit::
        
          git redmine issue submit 1
        
        To submit the last commit to issue 9999::
        
          git redmine issue submit --issue 9999 1
        
        issue apply
        ...........
        
        Apply patches attached to the current issue.::
        
          git redmine issue apply
        
        Apply patched atteched to issue 9999.::
        
          git redmine issue apply --issue 9999
        
        merge-and-push
        ..............
        
        Merge current feature branch in a target branch (default is master), push
        target branch to origin, delete feature branch locally and on origin; if before
        that those operations pass: pull-rebase the target branch, rebase feature
        branch on target.
        
          git rebase merge-and-push
