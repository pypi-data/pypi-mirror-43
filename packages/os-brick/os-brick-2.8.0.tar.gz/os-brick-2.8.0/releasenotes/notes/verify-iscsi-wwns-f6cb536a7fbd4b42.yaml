    Adds verification that found iSCSI devices have the expected WWN
    (must be provided in connection_properties). The attachment fails if
    the WWNs do not match. This prevents cases where a device already
    exists on the host from an old attachment that wasn't fully cleaned
    up, and the new attachment got the same LUN. Using this old device
    could lead to data corruption.
