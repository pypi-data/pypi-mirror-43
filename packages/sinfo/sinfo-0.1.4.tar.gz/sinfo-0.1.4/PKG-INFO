Description: # sinfo
        
        `sinfo` prints version information for loaded modules in the current session,
        Python, the OS, and the CPU. It is designed as a minimum measure to increase
        reproducibility and provides similar information as `sessionInfo` in R. The
        name is shortened to encourage regular usage through reduced typing =)
        
        ## Installation
        
        `sinfo` can be installed via `pip install sinfo`. It does not rely on a package
        manager to find version numbers since it fetches them from the module's version
        string. Its only dependency is `stdlib_list`, which is used to distinguish
        between standard library and third party modules.
        
        ## Usage
        
        `sinfo` is versatile and particularly useful when conducting exploratory data
        analysis in Jupyter Notebooks. Listing the version numbers of all loaded
        modules in the last cell of a Notebook is a simple way to ensure a minimum
        level of reproducibility that requires little additional effort. This practice
        is useful when revisiting code and when sharing code with colleagues. `sinfo`
        is meant to complement more robust practices such as frozen virtual
        environments, containers and binder Notebooks. The default behavior is to only
        print modules from outside the standard library.
        
        ```python
        import math
        import numpy
        import pandas
        import natsort
        # Exploratory data analysis goes here...
        ```
        
        ```python
        # The last code cell of a Notebook.
        import sinfo
        sinfo.sinfo()
        ```
        
        
        Output:
        
        ```
        natsort         5.3.3
        numpy           1.15.2
        pandas          0.23.4

        `math` is omitted since it is in the standard library, but can be included by
        specifying `print_std_lib=True`. To see not only the explicitly imported
        modules but also any dependencies they import, specify `print_implicit=True`.
        See the docstring for complete parameter info.

        ## Background
        
        `sinfo` started as minor modifications of `py_session`, and as it grew it
        became convenient to create a new package. `sinfo` was built with the help of
        information provided in stackoverflow answers and existing similar packages,
        including
