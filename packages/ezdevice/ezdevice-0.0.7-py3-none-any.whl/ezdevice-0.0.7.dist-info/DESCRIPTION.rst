# EZDevice-python

This project is in alpha test - you probably don't want this yet.

# Installation

You can install this package with the [pip utility](https://pypi.org/project/ezdevice/) (this project requires python 3):

pip install ezdevice-python

Once installed you can use this executable either as a command-line tool or as a library for your own python applications.

## Talking to your devices via the web from Python

You can use the [EZDeviceClient class](/doc/ezdevice.client.html) as a wrapper for the REST API exposed by the server.
Click the link to see the current crude generated HTML documention or see [the source code](/ezdevice/client.py) for
the current implemention. This library is not yet complete, essentially offering only an API to set the image shown on the screen.
Send me a note if you'd like to use it and a feature is missing and I'll add it.

All of the API operations are also available from the shell for testing. For instance, the following will show an image on the display.

```
# show a github logo
ezdevice --target JXXXX --claim --displayfile github.png
# show an HTML file
ezdevice --target JXXXX --claim --displayfile myfile.html
```

## Programming new devices

This tool _should_ automate the process of installing a ezdevice binary onto a new device. You run it as follows

ezdevice --install BOARDTYPE

Where boardtype is a pair of letters:

- JL for the TTGO T5 with a 2.13" eink screen
- JK for the TTGO T5 with a 2.9" red and black eink screen
- JY for the TTGO T5 with a 2.9" yellow and black eink screen
- JM for the TTGO T5s with a two color eink screen
- JR for the TTGO T4
- JO for the TTGO with a 18650 battery and OLED screen (I'm not sure if this has a model number)
- JG for the TTGO GROW plant sensor
- JT for the TTGO Camera (the skinny one with no motion sensor)
- JC for the TTGO Camera (the wider one with bigger screen and a motion sensor)
- MS for the M5STICK board
- MB for the M5BASIC board

Support for other device types will be released soon.
