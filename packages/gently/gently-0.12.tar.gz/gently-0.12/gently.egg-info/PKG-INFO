Description: # Gently
        
        Gently is a tool for designing and analysing control systems. It is not complete and in active development.
        
        It is being written in [Hy](http://hylang.org/ "Hy") (a dialect of Lisp embedded in Python) and aims to provide an expressive domain-specific language for designing and analysing control systems.
        
        It uses [python-control](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ "python-control") package for control systems related operations.
