Description: # EyesLibrary for Robot Framework
        
        ## Introduction
        
        EyesLibrary is a Robot Framework Library to automate visual software testing verification. EyesLibrary uses a Python SDK called [Eyes-Selenium](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/eyes-selenium) from the tool [Applitools Eyes](http://applitools.com/), and can be used with the [SeleniumLibrary](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary) and/or the [AppiumLibrary](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary) .
        
        This library is a fork of [Robot-AppEyes](https://github.com/NaviNet/Robot-AppEyes).
        In order to use EyesLibrary, you are required to [sign up](https://applitools.com/sign-up/) for a free account with Applitools. See the [Usage](https://github.com/joel-oliveira/EyesLibrary#usage) section.
        
        - Information about EyesLibrary keywords can be found on the [Keyword Documentation](https://joel-oliveira.github.io/EyesLibrary/) page.
        
        - The [Eyes Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/eyes-selenium/) page provides more information for that library.
        - More information about the SeleniumLibrary can be found on the [SeleniumLibrary Repo](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary) and in the [Keyword Documentation](http://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html).
        - More information about the AppiumLibrary can be found on the [AppiumLibrary Repo](https://github.com/serhatbolsu/robotframework-appiumlibrary) and in the [Keyword Documentation](http://serhatbolsu.github.io/robotframework-appiumlibrary/AppiumLibrary.html).
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - Python 2.7.14
        - Robot Framework 3.1.1
        - Eyes-Selenium 3.15.2
        - SeleniumLibrary 3.3.1 (For Web Tests)
        - AppiumLibrary 1.5.0.2 (For Mobile Tests)
        
        ## Installation
        
        The recommended **installation** method is using [pip](http://pip-installer.org):
        
            pip install robotframework-eyeslibrary
        
        To **update** both the library and all
        its dependencies to the latest version:
        
            pip install --upgrade robotframework-eyeslibrary
        
        To install a **specific version**:
        
            pip install robotframework-eyeslibrary==(DesiredVersion)
        
        #### Uninstall
        
        To uninstall EyesLibrary use the following pip command:
        
            pip uninstall robotframework-eyeslibrary

        ## Usage
        
        To write tests with Robot Framework and EyesLibrary,
        EyesLibrary must be imported into your Robot test suite.
        See [Robot Framework User Guide](http://code.google.com/p/robotframework/wiki/UserGuide) for more information.
        
        **Note** - You must create a [free account](https://applitools.com/sign-up/) with Applitools in order to run the
        EyesLibrary and return results. The Applitools site will
        allow you to sign up and you will then be provide with your own API key.
        This will then need to be added to the Robot Framework resource file common.robot, by removing 'YourApplitoolsKey' and replacing with your API Key.
        
        ## Running the Demo
        
        At _tests/acceptance_ directory, you can find Robot Framework tests for:
        
        - Web
        - Android Browser
        - Android Native App
        - Android Hybrid App
        - iOS Browser
        - iOS Native App
        - iOS Hybrid App
        
        Before running the tests, your Applitools Api Key must be set in _tests/acceptance/resources/common.robot_, by replacing "YourApplitoolsApiKey" with your own key.
        
        When running the mobile tests, you must replace the variables within _tests/acceptance/resources/mobile.robot_ with your own, as well as the ones in _tests/acceptance/resources/android.robot_ or _tests/acceptance/resources/ios.robot_, according to the OS in use.
        
        Before running the Mobile Hybrid App tests, you need to install the Demo App (APK found at _tests/resources_) in your device.
        
        For in depth detail on how the keywords function, read the Keyword documentation found here: [Keyword Documentation](https://joel-oliveira.github.io/EyesLibrary/)
        
        **Remember to include your Applitools API key otherwise the
        test will not run.** To run a test, open a command prompt within the _tests/acceptance_ folder and run:
        
            robot FILENAME.robot
        
        For example, to run the Test Suite for Web:
        
            robot web.robot
        
        **Note:** It is assumed that anyone who wants to use this demo script is already able to execute robot tests using Google Chrome.
        
        ## Things to Note When Using Applitools
        
        - The tests will be accepted automatically by Applitools Eyes after the first run because a new baseline is being created. A second test run will show a successful comparison between screens.
        - Changing the Applitools' Application Name variable value will create a new test entry in Applitools test result screen and a new baseline will be accepted automatically by Applitools Eyes on the first run.
        - The viewport size should not be set to greater values than the maximum size of the device's window. (For more information on using viewports, https://applitools.com/docs/topics/general-concepts/using-viewports-in-eyes.html)

        ## Credits
        
        EyesLibrary was forked from [Robot-AppEyes](https://github.com/NaviNet/Robot-AppEyes) on version 1.2.
        
        Robot-AppEyes authors:
        
        - [Thomas Armstrong](https://github.com/tbarmstrong)
        - [Simon McMorran](https://github.com/SIMcM)
        - [Gareth Nixon](https://github.com/GarethNixon)
        - [Adam Simmons](https://github.com/adamsimmons)
        
        EyesLibrary then emerged as an independent library from the original one, on version 2.0.
