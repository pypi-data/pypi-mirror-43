        <span style="color:green; font-size:4em;">Please use <a href="https://github.com/iluxonchik/rfc-bibtex/">rfc-bibtex</a> instead.</span>
        
        The package has **changed name on PyPi** from `rfc-bibtex` to `rfcbibtex`.
        
        You can install the new version with:
        
        `pip install rfcbibtex`
        
        or
        
        `pipenv install rfcbibtex`
        
        # RFCBibTex
        
        A command line tool that creates `BibTex` entries for IETF `RFC`s and `Internet Drafts`.
        It can read the list of `RFC`s and `Internet Drafts` to parse from various sources:
        
        * directly from `.tex` files
        * directly from `.aux` files
        * from a text file (one ID per line)
        * from command-line arguments
        
        Duplicate entires are filtered out.
        
        # Installation/Requirements
        
        You can use `pip` to install this command-line tool:
        
            pip install rfcbibtex
        
        or `pipenv`:
        
            pipenv install rfcbibtex
        
        <span style="color:red;">Please note, that <span style="color:green">rfcbibtex</span> is the new package name on PyPi. The deprecated version used <span style="color:green">rfc-bibtex</span>.</span>
        
        Alternatively, you can clone this repository or download the `rfc-bibtex.py`. This tool has no
        external dependencies, so as long as you have `Python 3.x` installed, everything
        should work fine.
        
        **Requirements**:
        
        * `Python 3.x`
        * internet connection
        
        ## Testing
        
        First, install the test dependencies:
        
        `pipenv install --dev`
        
        or 
        
        `pip install -r dev-requirements.txt`
        
        and then run:
        
        `python -m unittest discover tests`
        
        from the project root.
        
        # Usage
        
        This tool automates the requests to the `https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/<id>/<version>/bibtex/` and `https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/<id>/bibtex/` endpoints.
        
        ```
        usage: rfcbibtex [-h] [-f FILE_NAME] [-o FILE_NAME]
                        [inline_args [inline_args ...]]
        
        Generate BibTex entries for IETF RFCs and Internet Drafts. The list of IDs can
        be read from a file (including .tex and .aux) or directly from command-line
        arguments.
        
        positional arguments:
        inline_args           list of RFC and/or Internet Draft IDs, in any order.
        
        optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        -f FILE_NAME, --file FILE_NAME
                                read list of RFC and/or Internet Draft IDs from a
                                file. Supported file formats are the following: .tex,
                                .aux and .txt (one ID per line). If a file with any
                                other extension is provided, the tool attempts to read
                                it as a .txt file, containing one ID per line.
        -o FILE_NAME, --output FILE_NAME
                                output the resulting BibTex to a file
        ```
        
        ## Identifier Format
        
        The identifier format of RFCs is `rfc<rfc_num>`, where `<rfc_num>` is the RFC number.
        For example, for the [RFC specifying TLS 1.2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246) you
        would write `rfc5246` (**NOTE**: the identifiers are case-insensitive, so `RFC5246` and `rFc5246` are also accepted).
        
        The input format of Internet-Drafts(I-Ds) is `draft-<rest>`, where `<rest>` is the rest of
        the draft's name ([all Internet-Drafts begin with "draft"](https://www.ietf.org/id-info/guidelines.html#naming)). For example, for the
        [TLS 1.3 Draft 21]() you would write `draft-ietf-tls-tls13-21`.
        
        ## Read Inputs From Command Line
        
        Example command:
        
        `rfcbibtex RFC5246 draft-ietf-tls-tls13-21`
        
        **Output**:

        ## Read Identifiers From A file
        
        Option: `-f <file_name_1> ... <file_name_N>`
        
        Alternatively, identifiers can be specified in a file.  The following input formats are accepted:
        
        * `.tex`: if you specify an `.tex` file, the program will search for \cite{} commands in the file and
        extract those that appear to contain RFCs or Internet Drafts identifiers.
        * `.aux`: if you specify an `.aux` file, the program will search for \citation{} commands in the file
        and extract those that appear to contain RFCs or Internet Drafts identifiers.
        * `.txt`: the program defaults to this file type if the file's extension is neither `.tex`, nor `.aux`.
        This file type must contain a list of RFCs or Internet Drafts identifiers, one per line.
        
        Please note that the identifiers must be in the format specified in the [Identifier Format](#identifier-format) seciton.
        
        ### Reading Identifiers From A .tex File
        
        <a id="tex-file"></a>Consider that you have a file called `rfcs_and_ids.tex` with the following content:
        
            \documentclass{article}
            \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
        
            \title{This Is A Simple Tex File For The RFCBibtex Project Demo}
            \author{Illya Gerasymchuk}
            \date{March 2019}

            \usepackage{graphicx}
        
            \begin{document}
        
            \maketitle
        
            \section{Introduction}
            
            There is nothing special here, nothing fancy, just a document with a few citations, like
            \cite{RFC5246} this one. This one here \cite{the-documentary-2005} should not be parsed.
            While this one \cite{draft-ietf-tls-tls13-21} should. And finally, let's cite the
            TLS 1.3 RFC \cite{RFC8446}. Well, that's it folks. At least for now... This is a very basic
            file, just to test if \textbf{the basic} latex parsing is working.
        
            You can find the RFCBitex project here: https://github.com/iluxonchik/rfc-bibtex

            \section{Conclusion}
        
            As you can see, your .tex file may have various citations, but only the ones that are RFCs
            and/or Internet Draft IDs are parsed.

        ### Reading Identifiers From a .aux File
        
        Consider that you have a file called `rfcs_and_ids.aux` with the following content:
        
            \relax
            \citation{RFC5246}
            \citation{the-documentary-2005}
            \citation{draft-ietf-tls-tls13-21}
            \citation{RFC8446}
            \bibstyle{plain}
            \bibdata{references}
            \@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1}Introduction}{1}}
            \@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces The Universe}}{1}}
            \newlabel{fig:universe}{{1}{1}}
            \@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2}Conclusion}{1}}
        
        
        If you run:
        
        `rfcbibtex -f rfcs_and_ids.aux`
        
        You will get the [same output as in the previous section](#example-output).
        
        ### Reading Identifiers From a .txt File
        
        Consider that you have a file called `rfcs_and_ids.txt` with the following content:
        
            RFC5246
            the-documentary-2005
            draft-ietf-tls-tls13-21
            RFC8446
        
        If you run:
        
        `rfcbibtex -f rfcs_and_ids.aux`
        
        You will get the [same output as in the previous section](#example-output).
        
        ### Combining Multiple Files
        
        You can also combine multiple files with different types. You can even combine files and command line arguments.
        
        Let's assume you have a file called `rfcs.txt` with the following content:
        
            RFC5246
            rFc7231
        
        We will also use the [rfcs_and_ids.tex from a previous example](#tex-file). If you run:
        
        `rfcbibtex rfc1234 -f rfcs.txt rfcs_and_ids.tex`
        
        <a id="mixed-files-output"></a>You will get the following output:
        
            @misc{rfc7231,

        ### Output Contents To A File
        
        Option: `-o <file_name>`
        
        Considering  `rfcs.txt`and `rfcs_and_ids.tex` from the above above.
        
        If you run: 
        
        `rfcbibtex rfc1234 -f rfcs.txt rfcs_and_ids.tex -o output.bib`
        
        A file `output.bib` would be created **or overridden** with the [the same content as in the above output](#mixed-files-output).
        
        ## Error Handling and Warning
        
        The tool will print a warning in the following cases:
        
        * no explicit version defined for a draft id
        * drafts which have a new draft version update
        * drafts which have been assigned an `RFC` number
        * invalid identifier name provided as a **command-line argument** (invalid identifier names from files are simply not parsed)
        * errors in fetching from URLs
        
        It's important to note, that such errors **DO NOT break the correct functionality of the tool**. Those errors and warnings are printed out,
        but **IGNORED**. The generated BibTex files are valid, even when errors are found. Errors and warnings are only printed on the console
        (into the standard error output stream) and **never to the output files** (`-o` option).
        
        Here is an example of an output of errors and warnings:
