        :code:`topos-theme` is a HTML theme for `sphinx`_ that was originally developed
        for the `topos <topos-gh>`_ python package but it has now been extracted out
        into its own independent project.
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        To use this theme for your own sphinx sites first you need to install the
        :code:`topos-theme` package
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
           $ pip install topos-theme
        
        then in your :code:`conf.py`
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           extensions = [
               ...,
               "topos_theme"
           ]
        
           html_theme = "topos-theme"
        
        Finally rebuild your project and you should see that :code:`topos-theme` has taken
        effect.
