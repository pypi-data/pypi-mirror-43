:code:`topos-theme` is a HTML theme for `sphinx`_ that was originally developed
for the `topos <topos-gh>`_ python package but it has now been extracted out
into its own independent project.

Getting Started
---------------

To use this theme for your own sphinx sites first you need to install the
:code:`topos-theme` package

.. code-block:: sh

   $ pip install topos-theme

then in your :code:`conf.py`

.. code-block:: python

   extensions = [
       ...,
       "topos_theme"
   ]

   html_theme = "topos-theme"

Finally rebuild your project and you should see that :code:`topos-theme` has taken
effect.
