# Reviewboard Extension for review jupyter notebook

- This extension renders jupyter notebook so that it is easier to code review jupyter notebook.
- The extension use nbconvert locally for render, there's no need to convert the notebook to different format by yourself.
- The template kept the javascript definition, namely, if your jupyter notebook is using external library (plotly, MathJax), it will still show it for you.


## Limitiation:
- Due to the limitation of reviewboard plugin, this only render the file attachement

## TODO:
- Add tests
- Better support for diff (probably use nbdime) instead of the current built-in differ.
