v1.6.post1 - *2019-03-20*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Web interface**

- Show last snapshot size distribution, and first backup success date,
  in hostconfig edit-view.
- Show real-used-size instead of apparent-used-size in snapshot data
  distribution. If you have ZFS compression enabled, you'll see a drop
  in the snapshot size summaries (not in the total disk usage).
- Hide last-error message in hostconfig edit-view for hosts that are
  disabled.

**Other**

- Single Sign-On (Discourse style) can be enabled (using the optional
  kleides-dssoclient dependency). See KLEIDES_DSSO_ENDPOINT option.
- Tweak permissions so you don't need is_superuser powers anymore.
- Update BossoBillingPoster for posting backup data counts to (internal)
  Bosso system.


v1.5 - *2018-06-13*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Web interface**

- Show "time since last backup" in listing, instead of just OK/FAIL.

**Tasks**

- Add locking to dutree scanner, so the filesystem isn't raped. Only do
  one dutree scan at a time.
- Change scheduler: jobs are now scheduled ahead of time by deducting
  the expected duration.
- Fix rsync issue when remote directory permissions are wrong
  (unreadable by user). In that case, the download (as root user) would
  succeed, but later changes would fail locally (planb user).

**Other**

- Change schema, removing unnecessary weekly/monthly booleans.
- Fix ``total_size_mb`` in report, which was too large.
- Improve ``breport`` command to output to stdout by default.


v1.4 - *2018-04-06*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Web interface**

- Show job failures in hostconfig detail view.
- Reduce clutter in hostconfig list view, using smaller items and less
  clutter.
- Show average run time, instead of last run time.

**Other**

- Fix bug with sending of breport emails.
- Use git version for pip-install if available; add makefile for quick
  commands.
- Update qcluster argv so it's still considered busy while doing the
  dutree scan.


v1.3 - *2018-03-19*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Web interface**

- Disallow deletion of non-empty host groups.

**CLI**

- Add ``breport`` command to send out backup reports. See the template
  in templates/planb/report_email_body.txt. Note that the report is
  still in alpha stage. NOTE: To get e-mail reports as well, you need
  to have ``rst2html`` installed.
- Add ``--with-disabled`` to ``confexport`` command to get complete
  exports.
- Fix that planb runserver can be used for development (through
  PYTHONPATH propagation).

**Other**

- Dependency updates to Django 2.0+.
- Add backup history record keeping, for better logging and averages.


v1.2 - *2017-09-18*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Fix release, this time without pyc files and with wheel package.
  Run this for upload: python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel upload


v1.1 - *2017-09-18*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Settings**

- Add ``PLANB_DEFAULT_INCLUDES``.
- Rename ``ZFS_BIN``, ``SUDO_BIN`` and ``RSYNC_BIN`` to ``PLANB_<setting>``.
- Fix allowing use of alternate ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``.

**Web interface**

- Add hosts to hostgroup listing.
- Allow ordering hosts by enabled/queued/running.

**CLI**

- Add "stale mounts" listing (planb slist).
- Create "hostconfig" export in YAML or JSON format (planb confexport).

**Queue**

- Fix so long running jobs don't suffer from lost DB connections.

**Other**

- Misc refactoring/cleanup.


v1.0 - *2017-07-11*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Initial release.
