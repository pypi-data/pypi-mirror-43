      Group type is a type or label that can be selected at group creation
      time in OpenStack. It usually maps to a set of capabilities of the storage
      back-end driver to be used for this volume. Examples: "Performance",
      "SSD", "Backup", etc. This is equivalent to the
      <tt>cinder type-create</tt> command. Once the group type gets created,
      click the "Extra Specs" button to set up extra specs key-value
      pair(s) for that group type.
