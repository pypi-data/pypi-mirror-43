Path of Building API
====================

Pre-release Software Warning
----------------------------

| This library is currently in pre-release status and may change in the near future.
| Meanwhile I am looking forward to community feedback to accommodate most use cases.
| Pull requests are gladly accepted and much appreciated!

Introduction
------------

| Path Of Building API provides a comprehensive toolbox for processing
    `Path of Building <https://github.com/Openarl/PathOfBuilding>`_ pastebins.
| It is aimed at community developers:

* looking to add Path of Building functionality to their apps.
* upgrading from existing solutions.

| As PoB pastebins became the standard way to share theorycrafting and characters,
| community tools want to interact with them and users `increasingly expect such functionality
    <https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/aca7vl/path_of_leveling_a_tool_written_in_java_with_an/>`_.

Benefits from using this library:

* Focus on your app's core competences
* Spend your free time on unique features
* Backwards-compatibility as PoB's export format changes
* Tested and secure codebase

Features
--------

* Look up and process:
    * Character stats (DPS, life, etc.)
    * Skill trees
    * Skills, skill groups and links
    * Gear and item sets
    * Path of Building configuration settings
    * Build author's notes
* Exposes all of Path of Building's relevant stats and attributes in a simple and pythonic way.
* Low memory footprint through slots and dynamically generated attributes.
* Automatically calculates mod values on theorycrafted items.
* Secure against XML attacks thanks to the `defusedxml <https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/>`_ library.
