Description: # cfv - Command-line File Verify
        
        cfv is a utility to test and create a wide range of checksum verification files.
        It currently supports testing and creating sfv, sfvmd5, csv, csv2, csv4, md5, bsdmd5, sha1, sha224,
        sha256, sha384, sha512, torrent and crc files.
        Test-only support is available for par, par2.
        
        cfv was originally written by Matthew Mueller ([original project home](http://cfv.sourceforge.net/)).
        This is a [friendly fork of cfv](https://github.com/cfv-project/cfv) maintained by David Gnedt.
        
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cfv-project/cfv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cfv-project/cfv)
        
        ## Requirements
        
        Python ≥ 2.4 <https://www.python.org/>
        
        ### Optional
        
        * Python Imaging Library (PIL) <https://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/> or
          Pillow <https://python-pillow.org/>
          (only needed if you want to create the dimensions column of .crc files)
        * python-fchksum <http://code.fluffytapeworm.com/projects>
          (may speed up checksumming speed a bit, especially if your python was not built with the mmap module.)
        
        ## Install
        
        You can get the latest release from the [Github releases page](https://github.com/cfv-project/cfv/releases).
        
        ### Unix
        
        1. `make install` (which just runs `python setup.py install --prefix=/usr/local`)
        2. read man page, `cfv -h`, etc. have fun
        3. optional: run tests to verify correct operation: `cd test; ./test.py`
        
        ### Windows
        
        1. maybe `python setup.py install` will do something useful? At least it should stick the
           libraries in the right place
        2. move `cfv.bat` to somewhere in the path
        3. edit the `cfv.bat` file if your Python is installed somewhere other than `C:\python24`
