        ### Usage
        The code can be used as a **library**, for example in a Jupyter notebook. 
        In the `examples` folder you can find some examples. 
        
        Alternatively, you can run the code `analysis.py` from the **command line**.
        It can execute most of the cepstral analysis routines, returning the results in a series of data files and PDF plots.
        See the `examples` folder and the help (`python analysis.py --help`) for more information.
        
        ### Requirements
         - Python 2.7
         - Numpy
         - Scipy
         - Matplotlib
        
        ### Installation
          1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/lorisercole/thermocepstrum.git`
          2. Install the package with pip (dependencies will be automatically downloaded). For example:
        ```
        cd thermocepstrum
        pip install .
        ```
          3. You are done! You can check that the installation is working by trying to run the command `thermocepstrum-analysis`.
