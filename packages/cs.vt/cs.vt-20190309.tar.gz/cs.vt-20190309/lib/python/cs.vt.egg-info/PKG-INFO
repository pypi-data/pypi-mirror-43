Description: A content hash based data store with a filesystem layer, using
        variable sized blocks, arbitrarily sized data and utilising some
        domain knowledge to aid efficient block boundary selection.
        
        *Note*: the "mount" filesystem facility uses FUSE,
        which may need manual OS installation.
        On MacOS this means installing `osxfuse`
        for example from MacPorts.
        You will also need the `llfuse` Python module,
        which is not automatically required by this package.
        
        The package provides the `vt` command to access
        these facilities from the command line.
        
        This system has two main components:
        * Stores: storage areas of variable sized data blocks
          indexed by the cryptographic hashcode of their content
        * Dirents: references to filesystem entities
          containing hashcode based references to the content
        
        These are logically disconnected.
        Dirents are not associated with particular Stores;
        it is it sufficient to have access to any Store
        containing the required blocks.
        
        The other common entity is the Archive,
        which is just a text file containing
        a timestamped log of revisions of a Dirent.
        These can be mounted as a FUSE filesystem,
        and the `vt pack` command simply stores
        a directory tree into the current Store,
        and records the stored reference in an Archive file.

        (http://library.pantek.com/general/plan9.documents/venti/venti.html,
        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venti)
        which is also a system based on variable sized blocks.
