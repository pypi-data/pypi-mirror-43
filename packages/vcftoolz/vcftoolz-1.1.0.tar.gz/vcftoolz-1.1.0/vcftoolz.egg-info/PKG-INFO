        Features
        --------
        
        * Compares the snps in two or more VCF files.
        * Lists the snps that are unique to each VCF file with full genotype information per snp.
        * Lists the snps that are missing from each VCF file if present in at least two other VCF files.
        * Generates Venn diagrams of positions and snps in the VCF files.
        * Reports precision, recall, and F1 score when the truth is known.
        * Reports the effectiveness of filtered variants when the truth is known.
        * Reformat the VCF file in a tall-narrow format for easy viewing and diffs.
