logsweet
========

   A suite with a variety of tools for handling log messages.

The name *logsweet* is a word play by combining *sweet logging* and a
*suite of logging tools*.

Requirements
------------

-  Python ≥3.4

Installation
------------

Python Package ``logsweet``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   pip install logsweet

or

::

   python ./setup.py install

Docker Image ``mastersign/logsweet``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a public Docker image for *logsweet* available.

.. code:: sh

   docker run --rm -it mastersign/logsweet [command] [OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS]

Remember to mount log files as volumes into the container, when using
the ``watch`` or ``mock`` command.

Usage
-----

Logsweet supports the following commands:

-  ``watch`` watches for new lines in text files (e.g. log files) and
   broadcasts them via a ∅MQ PUB socket and/or sends them via a ∅MQ PUSH
   socket.
-  ``listen`` listens to new lines broadcasted via ∅MQ PUB socket and/or
   collects new lines from ∅MQ PUSH sockets and prints them on the
   console.
-  ``proxy`` can connect to watchers at the backend and to listeners at
   the frontend. It supports both transmission modes (PUB/SUB and
   PUSH/PULL) at both backend and frontend. It can be used as a single
   point of knowledge or to build groups of log streams.
-  ``mock`` to write random log messages to text files for testing
   purposes.

One or more known services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

At the service hosts ``service-1`` and ``service-2`` run:

.. code:: sh

   logsweet watch -b *:9000 "/var/log/myservice/*.log"

To watch the two services:

.. code:: sh

   logsweet listen -c service-1:9000 -c service-2:9000

Use a proxy for dynamic services
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First start the proxy on host ``log-proxy`` to wait for backend
connections from services on port 9001 and frontend connections from
listeners on port 9002:

.. code:: sh

   logsweet proxy -bb *:9001 -fb *:9002

Run one or more listeners to print the messages:

.. code:: sh

   logsweet listen -c log-proxy:9002

Start one or more watchers to send log messages to the proxy:

.. code:: sh

   logsweet watch -c log-proxy:9001 "/var/log/myservice/*.log"

Use two proxies for high availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First start two proxies on host ``log-proxy-1`` and ``log-proxy-2``:

.. code:: sh

   logsweet proxy -bb *:9001 -fb *:9002

Then start one or more listeners to print the messages:

.. code:: sh

   logsweet listen -c log-proxy-1:9002 -c log-proxy-2:9002

Start one or more watchers to send log messages to the proxies:

.. code:: sh

   logsweet watch -c log-proxy-1:9002 -c log-proxy-2:9002 "/var/log/myservice/*.log"

If multiple proxies are alive, the load is balanced evenly over all
proxies. If a proxy becomes unavailable, its load is automatically taken
by the remaining proxies.

Write random log messages for testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can write random log messages to one or more log files in order to
test *logsweet* and its usage scenarios:

.. code:: sh

   logsweet mock -i 0.2 /var/log/test/1.log /var/log/test/2.log

Use the ``-i`` or ``--interval`` option to control the interval for new
log messages in seconds.

Configuration
-------------

The commands ``watch`` and ``listen`` can process a YAML configuration
file. The configuration controls *filtering*, *coloring* output and
triggering *actions*.

For the command ``watch`` to print the text lines, the switch ``--echo``
must be used.

A configuration file is specified with the ``-cfg <yaml file>`` option.
Here is an example:

.. code:: yaml

   version: '0.1'

   # The include statement is an array of regular expressions or a single one.
   # A log messages is dropped if it does not match any of the expressions.
   include:
     - 'error|Error|ERROR'
     - 'warning|Warning|WARNING'

   # The exclude statement is an array of regular expressions or a single one.
   # A log message is dropped if it matches any of the expressions.
   exclude: 'ignore\s+this'

   # The colors statement is an array of colorization rules.
   # The rules are tried in the given order until one matches.
   colors:
     # A colorization rule must have a pattern, which is a regular expression,
     # optionally with named groups.
     - pattern: '\[ERROR\]'
       # There are multiple color statements with the syntax of.
       # <foreground color> [on <background color>]
       # Every color is a color name from the X11 rgb.txt.
       # Spcifically the names supported by the Python package colorful
       # are supported.
       # The color names are Camel Case with a lower first letter.
       line: red  # line specifies a color for the whole line
       match: black on lightGrey # match specifies a color for the whole match

     - pattern: '^.*?(?P<level>\[[A-Z]+\]).*(?P<user>admin|user)'
       line: lightGrey
       match: white
       level: yellow
       user: cyan

   # The actions statement is an array of action rules.
   # The rules are all tried, regardless of matches.
   # To execute actions from a watch or listen command,
   # the switch -x or --exec-action must be used.
   actions:
     # An action rule must have a pattern, which is a regular expression,
     # optionally with named groups.
     - pattern: '\[ERROR\] (?P<err>.*)$'
       # If the rule has an url property, it is considered an HTTP GET action.
       # The URL is treaded as a Python string template,
       # that means it can contain variables from the named regex groups.
       url: 'http://127.0.0.1:23456/notify-error/${err}'
       # A timeout in seconds can be specified,
       # to limit the amount of time used to execute the HTTP request.
       timeout: 2.5
