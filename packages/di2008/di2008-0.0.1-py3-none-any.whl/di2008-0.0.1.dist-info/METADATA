# Purpose

To provide an easy-to-use, object-oriented instrument interface for the [DATAQ DI-2008](https://www.dataq.com/products/di-2008/) from within any Python environment.

# Installation

The hardware drivers must be installed before this package may be utilized.  Hardware drivers may be downloaded from the [manufacturer's product page](https://www.dataq.com/products/di-2008/).

Once drivers are installed:

    $> pip install di2008

# Project Status and Future

The objects provided are tested and demonstrated to function well, however, there are still lots of features that have not been implemented.

Items marked out have already been completed.  The list is in approximate order of priority and marked out items have been completed.

 * ~~Implement Analog Scan List~~ complete
 * ~~Read Thermocouples~~ complete
 * ~~Read Analog Inputs~~ complete
 * ~~Read Rate Input~~ complete
 * Read Event Input
 * Read Counter Input
 * Read Digital Input(s)
 * Write to Digital Outputs
 * Hardware Synchronization

# Usage

Place device into 'COM' mode:

 1. Disconnect from USB
 2. Wait 5 seconds
 3. Connect to USB and press button on side rapidly until LED changes

The device setting is persistent and will not need to be changed again.  You should see a COM port in your device manager with the label `DATAQ DI-2008` when the device is in the appropriate mode.
