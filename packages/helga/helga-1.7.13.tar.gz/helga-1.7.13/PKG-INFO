        About
        -----
        Helga is a full-featured chat bot for Python 2.7 using `Twisted`_. Helga originally started
        as a python fork of a perl-based IRC bot `olga`_, but has grown considerably since then. Early
        versions limited to support to IRC, but now include other services like XMPP and HipChat.
        Full documentation can be found at http://helga.readthedocs.org.
        
        
        Supported Backends
        ------------------
        
        As of version 1.7.0, helga supports IRC, XMPP, and HipChat out of the box. Note, however, that
        helga originally started as an IRC bot, so much of the terminology will reflect that. The current
        status of XMPP and HipChat support is very limited and somewhat beta. In the future, helga may
        have a much more robust and pluggable backend system to allow connections to any number of chat
        services.
