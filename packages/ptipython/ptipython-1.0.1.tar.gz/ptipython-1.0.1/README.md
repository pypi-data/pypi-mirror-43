# PyPI metapackage for ptipython

The only purpose for this package is to install `ptpython` and `ipython` with one package. <br>
The only reason for this is because of this issue in the `try` repository: https://github.com/timofurrer/try/issues/5

If someone has a better solution for the problem I'm more than happy to remove this package from PyPI.
