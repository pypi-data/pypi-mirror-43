Description: ARA Records Ansible
        ===================

        ARA Records Ansible playbook runs and makes the recorded data available and
        intuitive for users and systems.
        
        The project provides several distinct components in order to make this happen:
        
        - An API server for sending and querying data relative to playbook execution results
        - An API client library for communicating with the API
        - An Ansible callback plugin to record events as they happen throughout the execution
        - An Ansible action module to associate arbitrary key/values to your playbook reports
        
        Quickstart
        ==========
        
        Here's how you can get started from scratch with default settings::
        
            # Create a virtual environment
            python3 -m venv ~/.ara/venv
        
            # Install Ansible and the required ARA projects
            ~/.ara/venv/bin/pip install ansible
            ~/.ara/venv/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/openstack/ara@feature/1.0
        
            # Tell Ansible to use the ARA callback plugin
            # "python -m ara.plugins" provides the path to the ARA plugins directory
            export ANSIBLE_CALLBACK_PLUGINS="$(~/.ara/venv/bin/python -m ara.plugins)/callback"
        
            # Run your playbook as your normally would
            ~/.ara/venv/bin/ansible-playbook playbook.yml
        
        The data will be saved in real time throughout the execution of the Ansible playbook.
        
        What happens behind the scenes is that the ARA Ansible callback plugin used
        the built-in API client to send the data to the API which then saved it to a
        database located by default at ``~/.ara/server/ansible.sqlite``.
        
        You're now ready to start poking at the API with the built-in API clients !

        Development
        ===========
        
        **TL;DR**: Using tox is convenient for the time being::
        
          # Retrieve the source
          git clone https://github.com/openstack/ara
          cd ara
          git checkout feature/1.0
        
          # Install tox from pip or from your distro packages
          pip install tox
        
          # Run test server -> http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/
          tox -e runserver
        
          # Run actual tests or get coverage
          tox -e linters
          tox -e py3
          tox -e cover
        
          # Build docs
          tox -e docs
