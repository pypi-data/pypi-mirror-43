Description: # Disk
        
        Disk is a Python library for interacting with the file system in an object oriented manner. I know you can use os and os.path to do all of these but I find their usage hard to remember and not very object oriented. 
        
        # Installation
        
        You can use pip to install Disk.
        
        ```bash
        pip install disk
        ```
        
        # Usage
        
        Disk is an object oriented interface for the file system. All files and directories (folders) are considered *Path* objects. Any path except the root, has a parent: the directory it is in. Directories have children, some of them are files and some are subdirectories.
        
        ## Path
        
        Usually we want to start in the current working directory:
        
        ```python
        from disk import Path
        current_directory = Path.get_current_directory()
        
        # ls or dir:
        print(current_directory.list())
        
        # get the first subdirectory:
        first_subdirectory = current_directory.directories[0]
        
        # get the parent directory:
        parent_directory = current_directory.parent_directory
        ```
