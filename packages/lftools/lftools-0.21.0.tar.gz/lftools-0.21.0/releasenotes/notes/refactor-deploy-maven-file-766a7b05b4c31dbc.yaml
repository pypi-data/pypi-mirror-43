features:
  - |
    Refactored deploy_maven_file() function from shell/deploy to pure Python to
    be more portable with Windows systems.
upgrade:
  - |
    The ``deploy maven-file`` command no longer calls maven (relying instead on
    a direct REST call to Nexus). Due to this change, the following options
    have been removed:

    * ``-b|--maven-bin``
    * ``-gs|--global-settings``
    * ``-s|--settings``
    * ``-p|--maven-params``

    Additionally, the NEXUS_URL argument should now contain only the base URL
    for the Nexus server being used, rather than the full path to the remote
    repository.

    Any calls to this command should be updated to reflect the above changes.
    Nexus credentials should be located in the local .netrc file.
deprecations:
  - |
    ``shell/deploy`` script's deploy_maven_file() function is now deprecated
    and will be removed in a future release.
