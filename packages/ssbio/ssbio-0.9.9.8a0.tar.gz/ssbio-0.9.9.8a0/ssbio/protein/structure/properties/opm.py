### Server

# http://opm.phar.umich.edu/server.php
#
# ### Definitions:
#
# Depth or hydrophobic thickness. This parameter indicates the calculated hydrophobic thickness
# (for TM proteins) or maximal penetration depth of protein atoms into the lipid hydrocarbon core
# (for peripheral/monotopic) proteins. The ± values for the depth and tilt angle show fluctuations of
# the corresponding parameters within 1 kcal/mol around the global minimum of transfer energy.
#
# Tilt angle is calculated between membrane normal (Z axis) and protein axis. The protein axis is
# calculated as the sum of TM secondary structure segment vectors (for TM proteins) or as the principal
# inertia axis (for peripheral proteins).
#
# Transfer energy of the protein from water to lipid bilayer. This energy roughly corresponds to the
# actual membrane binding energy for water-soluble peripheral proteins, unless: (a) some membrane-anchoring
# elements are missing or disordered in the crystal structure; (b) there is strong specific binding of lipids
# (e.g. in PH domains and other "lipid clamps"), or (c) membrane binding is coupled with significant structural
# changes of the protein (e.g. helix-coil transition for amphiphilic α-helices). In situations (a) and (b), the
# calculated membrane binding free energy is underestimated. In situation (c) it is usually overestimated.
#
# Table of membrane-embedded residues consists of two parts: (a) list of residues penetrating into the hydrocarbon
# core of the lipid bilayer for each subunit (tilt angles of individual subunits in this part are calculated based
# on the principal inertia axis), and (b) parts of transmembrane alpha-helices or beta-strands that are embedded
# into the hydrocarbon core (the entire secondary structures can be longer; tilt angles of individual subunits
# in this part are calculated as vector averages of TM secondary structure segment vectors).
#
# Output coordinate file for a protein positioned in the lipid bilayer. The origin of coordinates corresponds
# to the center of lipid bilayer. Z axis coincides with membrane normal; atoms with the positive sign of Z coordinate
# are arranged in the "outer" leaflet as defined by the user-specified topology. Positions of DUMMY atoms correspond
# to locations of lipid carbonyl groups.
#
# Diagnostic messages. The server produces diagnostic messages in a separate window. Please report these messages to
# developer if program aborts.
