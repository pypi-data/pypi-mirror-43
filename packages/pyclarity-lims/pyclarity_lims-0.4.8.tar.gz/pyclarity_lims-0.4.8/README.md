Pyclarity-lims is a fork of [genologics](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/genologics) that we have extended and modified.
Most of the initial logic still applies and the `genologics` module still exists as an alias for backward compatibility.
However there are a few backward incompatible changes that have had to be made.
