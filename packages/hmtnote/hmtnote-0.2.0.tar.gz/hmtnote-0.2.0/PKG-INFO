        Features
        --------
        
        HmtNote is a bioinformatics tool that can be used to annotate human mitochondrial variants from a VCF, using data available on HmtVar_.
        
        Annotations are grouped into basic, cross-reference, variability and predictions, depending on the type of information they provide.

        Usage
        -----
        
        Command Line Interface
        ======================
        
        HmtNote can be used as a command line tool, by simply providing the original VCF and the filename where the annotated VCF will be saved::
        
            hmtnote input_vcf.vcf annotated_vcf.vcf
        
        By default, HmtNote will annotate the VCF using all four groups of annotations (basic, cross-reference, variability and predictions). If desired, you can specify which kind of annotation you want, using respectively ``--basic``, ``--crossref``, ``--variab`` and ``--predict`` (or ``-b``, ``-c``, ``-v``, ``-p``)::
        
            hmtnote input_vcf.vcf annotated_basic_vcf.vcf --basic
            hmtnote input_vcf.vcf annotated_crossreferences_vcf.vcf --crossref
            hmtnote input_vcf.vcf annotated_variability_vcf.vcf --variability
            hmtnote input_vcf.vcf annotated_predictions_vcf.vcf --predict
        
        Python Module
        =============
        
        HmtNote can also be imported in a Python script and its function ``annotate_vcf()`` can be used to annotated a given VCF::
        
            from hmtnote import annotate_vcf
            annotate_vcf("input_vcf.vcf", "annotated_vcf.vcf")
        
        By default, ``annotate_vcf()`` will annotate the VCF using all four groups of annotations (basic, cross-reference, variability and predictions). If desired, you can specify which kind of annotation you want, using respectively the ``basic=True``, ``crossref=True``, ``variab=True``, ``predict=True`` arguments::
        
            annotate_vcf("input_vcf.vcf", "annotated_basic_vcf.vcf", basic=True)
            annotate_vcf("input_vcf.vcf", "annotated_crossreferences_vcf.vcf", crossref=True)
            annotate_vcf("input_vcf.vcf", "annotated_variability_vcf.vcf", variab=True)
            annotate_vcf("input_vcf.vcf", "annotated_predictions_vcf.vcf", predict=True)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        **PLEASE NOTE: HmtNote only supports Python 3!**
        
        The preferred installation method for HmtNote is using ``pip`` in a conda environment:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ conda install requests
            $ conda install -c bioconda cyvcf2
            $ pip install hmtnote
        
        If you have issues, please refer to the Installation_ section of the Documentation_.
