Licence
=======

PyNN is freely available under the CeCILL v2 license, which is equivalent to, and
compatible with, the GNU GPL license, but conforms to French law (and is also
perfectly suited to international projects) - see
`<http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html>`_ for more information. The choice
of GPL-equivalence was made to match the licenses of other widely-used simulation
software in computational neuroscience, such as NEURON (GPL) and Brian (CeCILL).

If you are interested in using PyNN, but the choice of licence is a problem for you, please contact us to discuss dual-licensing.
