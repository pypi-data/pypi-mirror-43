A tool that automates the transformation of normal python projects to virtual environments. In simple words, the tool creates a virtual environment and automatically installs all the dependencies used in your project by identifying them and migrates the project to the newly created virtual environment.

```

<p><strong>app_root_directory</strong> : The root directory of your project</p>
<p><strong>virtual_env_directory</strong> : The place where virtualenv should be created</p>
