## Rationale

For some time now, I've been settling on Python as my preferred general-purpose language,  with its vast amount of very nice modules and frameworks. Along with Python, I really like Heroku as an incredible simple deployment target. Besides Heroku, I also heavily use Raspberry Pi nodes. Most of the time the same code runs on Heroku and on a Pi, so I ended up with a quest to make deployment on a Pi as identical to the experience on Heroku. Hence PiroQ - pronounced "ku" at the end - wonder why ;-)
