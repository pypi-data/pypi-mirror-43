# Usage

## Load and show image from file

```zsh
from rakali import Image
Image.from_file('rakali.jpg').show()
```

# Install

Rakali is basically a OpenCV shim. Because many people use their own builds of OpenCV to enable CUDA or the
like, installing Rakali may interfere with exiting custom OpenCV builds so be sure to verify OpenCV versions
after installing Rakali. 

## Manual install

Clone or download this repo and in your virtualenv do:
```
$ pip install .
```
