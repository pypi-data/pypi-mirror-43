Description: # Kommando.py
        A very extensible command parser for discord.py [rewrite]
        
        ## Requirements
        * Python 3.6+
        * `discord.py` library [rewrite]
        
        ## F.A.Q
        
        #### When i should use it instead of ext.commands?
        When you need things ext.commands can't do, when its to hard to make a workaround,
        or you just wanna make very custom commands, etc
        
        #### When i shouldn't use it?
        When you are still learning python, when you need stability (still a pre-release),
        or when you are to uptight to try something new
        
        #### When you will release some documentation?
        Soon!
        
        #### What are the main advantages?
        - Custom methods, control of the entire command parsing
        - Extensions, modular and total customization of your Bot, with
        partial reloads and custom states at runtime
        - Live Objects, inteligent use of callbacks
        - Long-lived (or even permanent) paginators
        - Multiple tasks for client events
        - Easy translations and customized behaviours
        - Brand-new features
        
        #### Soo why the custom Oni ordered an HellBox?
        For Hellpy someone
        
        #### Why this is still here? I mean, the bots aren't called onis anymore, the hellboxes are now contexts, and the project was never called Hellpy
