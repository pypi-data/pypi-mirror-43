Install the package.

    $ pip install ls.joyous

Add ``ls.joyous`` and ``wagtail.contrib.modeladmin`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'ls.joyous',
        'wagtail.contrib.modeladmin',
        # ... etc ...
        ]

Compatibility
--------------
I am aiming to support the latest releases of Wagtail and Django.  Older versions may be dropped without much notice.  Let me know if that is a problem for you.  Other versions may work - YMMV.

FYI: Django 2.1 is a definite minimum requirement.
