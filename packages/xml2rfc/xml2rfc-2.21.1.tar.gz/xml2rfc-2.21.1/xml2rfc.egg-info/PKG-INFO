Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.

        Version 2.21.1 (11 Mar 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This is a bugfix release, containing a number of fixes and adjustments
          in response to issues reported by the RFC Editor staff.  Excerpt from
          the commit log:
        
          * Fixed an incorrect <u> format in a test file.
        
          * Broadened the handling of <svg> viewBox attribute values, to permit 
            commas and enclosing parentheses.
        
          * Added some missing default_options settings.  Moved the calculation of 
            various element tag sets (inline tags, for instance) out of the 
            BaseV3Writer class to avoid doing the same thing repeatedly when not 
            necessary.
        
          * Fixed a flawed check for the presence of at least one required element 
            in the <u> format specification.
        
          * Added a z-index setting to avoid links being overlaid by h* padding 
            stretching up over previous elements.
        
          * Added a new option --no-pagination, and a startup check for missing 
            default options.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.21.0 (04 Mar 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release introduces the switch --no-org-info to control the display
          of author organization information on the front page, for vocabulary v2
          documents, and the <organization> attribute "showOnFrontPage" to do the
          same for v3 documents.  The handling is different for the two in order
          to avoid retrofitting new attributes to the v2 DTD.  From the commit
          log:
        
          * Added support for a --no-org-info switch, to suppress organization 
            rendering on the first page for v2 renderers.
        
          * Added support for the showOnFrontPage attribute to v3 renderers, and a
            test case for the showOnFrontPage attribute.
        
          * Added <organization> attribute "showOnFirstPage" (default "true") to 
            the schema.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.20.1 (27 Feb 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Handle initials==Null return value from short_author_name_parts().  
            Fixes issue #397
