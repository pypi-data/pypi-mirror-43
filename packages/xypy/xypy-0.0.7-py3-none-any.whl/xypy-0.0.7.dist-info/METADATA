Summary: A simulation framework for supervised learning data. The functionalities are specifically                   designed to let the user a maximum degrees of freedom, to ultimately fulfill the research purpose.                   Furthermore, feature importances of the simulation can be created on a local and a global level.                    This is particular interesting, for instance, to benchmark feature selection algorithms.

Simulating Supervised Learning Data <img src="/img/Xy.png" alt="drawing" width="150px" align="right"/> 
===================================


With `xypy.Xy()` you can convienently simulate supervised learning data, e.g. regression and classification problems. 
The simulation can be very specific, since there are many degrees of freedom for the user. For instance, the functional 
shape of the nonlinearity is user-defined as well. Interactions can be formed and (co)variances altered. For a more 
specific motivation you can visit our [blog](https://www.statworx.com/de/blog/simulating-regression-data-with-xy-in-python/). 
I have adapted this package from my R version, which you can check out [here](https://www.github.com/andrebeleier/Xy).

### Usage

You can can checkout details about the package on [testPYPI](https://test.pypi.org/project/xypy/) or on 
[GitHub](https://www.github.com/andrebleier/xypy).

You can convienently install the package via PYPI with the following command.
```
pip install xypy
```
There is an example test script on my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/andrebleier/xypy), which will you get started
with the simulation.

### Simulate data 

You can simulate regression and classification data with interactions and a user-specified non-linearity. With 
the <code>stn</code> argument you can alter the signal to noise ratio of your simulation. I strongly encourage you to 
read this [blog post](https://www.statworx.com/de/blog/pushing-ordinary-least-squares-to-the-limit-with-xy/), 
where I've analyzed OLS coefficients with different signal to noise ratios.

```
# load the library
from xypy import Xy
# simulate regression data
my_sim = Xy(n = 1000, 
            numvars = [10,10], 
            catvars = [3, 2], 
            noisevars = 50, 
            stn = 100.0)

# get a glimpse of the simulation
my_sim

# plot the true underlying effects
my_sim.plot()

# extract the data
X, y = my_sim.data

# extract the true underlying model weights
my_sim.coef_
```

### Feature Selection

You can extract a feature importance of your simulation. For instance, to benchmark feature selection algorithms. 
You can read up on a small benchmark I did with this feature 
on our [blog](https://www.statworx.com/de/blog/benchmarking-feature-selection-algorithms-with-xy/). 
You can perform the same analysis easily in Python as well.

```
# Feature Importance 
my_sim.varimp()
```
