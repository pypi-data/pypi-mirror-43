pre-requisites and get your LED Matrix up and running with minimal
efforts. To run it, fire up Terminal which you'll find in Menu ->
Accessories -> Terminal on your Raspberry Pi desktop, as illustrated
below:

If you want to contribute, or like living on the edge of your seat by
having the latest code, you should clone this repository, ``cd`` to the
library directory, and run:

.. code:: bash

    sudo python3 setup.py install

(or ``sudo python setup.py install`` whichever your primary Python
environment may be)

In all cases you will have to enable the i2c bus.
