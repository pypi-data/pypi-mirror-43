   SpamScope

Overview
========

SpamScope is an advanced spam analysis tool that use `Apache
Storm <http://storm.apache.org/>`__ with
`streamparse <https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse>`__ to process a
stream of mails. To understand how SpamScope works, I suggest to read
these overviews: - `Apache Storm
Concepts <http://storm.apache.org/releases/1.2.1/Concepts.html>`__ -
`Streamparse
Quickstart <http://streamparse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/quickstart.html>`__

In general the first step is run Apache Storm, then you can run the
topologies on it. SpamScope has some topologies in `topologies
folder <./topologies/>`__, but you can make others topologies.

What Does SpamScope do?
=======================

SpamScope gets the raw emails (both RFC822 and Outlook formats) in input
and returns an JSON object. Then it extracts urls and attachments (if
they are zipped extracts the content files). All informations are saved
in JSON objects. This is the first analysis. After that SpamScope runs a
*phishing* module, that gives a *phishing score* to the emails.

Then you can enable/disable post processing modules, that connect
SpamScope with third party tools. There are three main categories: - raw
emails analysis - attachments analysis - sender emails analysis

It’s possible to add new modules in these three categories, if you want
connect SpamScope with others tools.

Raw emails analysis
-------------------

These modules (see `here <./src/modules/mails>`__) analyze the raw
emails: - SMTP dialect - SpamAssassin

Attachments analysis
--------------------

These modules (see `here <./src/modules/attachments>`__) analyze the
attachments of emails: - Apache Tika - Store sample on disk (as default
SpamScope saves samples in JSON objects) - Thug - VirusTotal - Zemana

Sender emails analysis
----------------------

SpamScope can detects the exact sender IP and then it can analyze it
(see `here <./src/modules/networks>`__): - Shodan - VirusTotal

Why should I use SpamScope
==========================

-  It’s very fast: the job is splitted in functionalities that work in
   parallel.
-  It’s flexible: you can choose what SpamScope has to do.
-  It’s distributed: SpamScope uses Apache Storm, free and open source
   distributed realtime computation system.
-  It makes JSON output that you can save where you want.
-  It’s easy to setup: there are docker images and docker-compose ready
   for use.
-  It’s integrated with Apache Tika, VirusTotal, Thug, Shodan and
   SpamAssassin (for now).
-  It’s free and open source (for special functions you can contact me).
-  It can analyze Outlook msg.

Distributed
-----------

SpamScope uses Apache Storm that allows you to start small and scale
horizontally as you grow. Simply add more workers.

Flexibility
-----------

You can choose your mails input sources (with **spouts**) and your
functionalities (with **bolts**).

SpamScope comes with the following bolts: - **tokenizer** splits mail in
token like headers, body, attachments and it can filter emails,
attachments and ip addresses already seen - **phishing** looks for your
keywords in email and connects email to targets (bank, your customers,
etc.) - **raw_mail** is for all third party tools that analyze raw mails
like SpamAssassin - **attachments** analyzes all mail attachments and
uses third party tools like VirusTotal - **network** analyzes all sender
ip addresses with third party tools like Shodan - **urls** extracts all
urls in email and attachments - **json_maker** and **outputs** make the
json report and save it

Store where you want
--------------------

You can build your custom output bolts and store your data in
Elasticsearch, MongoDB, filesystem, etc.

Build your topology
-------------------

With streamparse tecnology you can build your topology in Python, add
and/or remove spouts and bolts.

API
---

For now SpamScope doesn’t have its own API, because it isn’t tied to any
tecnology. If you use ``Redis`` as spout (input), you’ll use Redis API
to put mails in topology. If you use ``Elasticsearch`` as output, you’ll
use Elasticsearch API to get results.

It’s possible to develop a middleware API that it talks with input,
output and changes the configuration, but now there isn’t.

Apache 2 Open Source License
============================

SpamScope can be downloaded, used, and modified free of charge. It is
available under the Apache 2 license.

Requirements
============

For operating system requirements you can read `Ansible
playbooks <./ansible>`__, that go into details.

For Python requirements you can read: \* `mandatory
requirements <./requirements.txt>`__ \* `optional
requirements <./requirements_optional.txt>`__

*Thug* is another optional requirement, that it’s not in requirements.
See `Thug section <#thug-optional>`__ for more details.

Apache Storm
------------

`Apache Storm <http://storm.apache.org/>`__ is a free and open source
distributed realtime computation system.

streamparse
-----------

`streamparse <https://github.com/Parsely/streamparse>`__ lets you run
Python code against real-time streams of data via Apache Storm.

mail-parser
-----------

`mail-parser <https://github.com/SpamScope/mail-parser>`__ is the
parsing for raw email of SpamScope.

Faup
----

`Faup <https://github.com/stricaud/faup>`__ stands for Finally An Url
Parser and is a library and command line tool to parse URLs and
normalize fields.

rarlinux (optional)
-------------------

`rarlinux <https://www.rarlab.com/>`__ unarchives rar file.

SpamAssassin (optional)
-----------------------

SpamScope can use `SpamAssassin <http://spamassassin.apache.org/>`__ an
open source anti-spam to analyze every mails.

Apache Tika (optional)
----------------------

SpamScope can use `Apache Tika <https://tika.apache.org/>`__ to parse
every attachments. The Apache Tika toolkit detects and extracts metadata
and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS,
and PDF). To use Apache Tika in SpamScope you must install
`tika-app-python <https://github.com/fedelemantuano/tika-app-python>`__
with ``pip`` and `Apache
Tika <https://tika.apache.org/download.html>`__.

Thug (optional)
---------------

From release v1.3 SpamScope can analyze Javascript and HTML attachments
with `Thug <https://github.com/buffer/thug>`__. If you want to analyze
the attachments with Thug, follow `these
instructions <http://buffer.github.io/thug/doc/build.html>`__ to install
it. Enable it in ``attachments`` section of `main configuration
file <./conf/spamscope.example.yml>`__.

What is Thug? From README project: > Thug is a Python low-interaction
honeyclient aimed at mimicing the behavior of a web browser in order to
detect and emulate malicious contents.

You can see a complete SpamScope report with Thug analysis
`here <https://goo.gl/Y4kWCv>`__.

Thug analysis can be very slow and you can have ``heartbeat timeout``
errors in Apache Storm. To avoid any issue set
``supervisor.worker.timeout.secs``:

::

   nr. user agents * timeout_thug < supervisor.worker.timeout.secs

The best value for ``threshold`` is 1.

VirusTotal (optional)
---------------------

It’s possible add to results (for mail attachments and sender ip
address) the VirusTotal report. You need a private API key.

Shodan (optional)
-----------------

It’s possible add to results the Shodan report for sender ip address.
You need a private API key.

Elasticsearch (optional)
------------------------

It’s possible to store the results in Elasticsearch. In this case you
should install ``elasticsearch`` package.

Redis (optional)
----------------

It’s possible to store the results in Redis. In this case you should
install ``redis`` package.

Configuration
=============

Read the `example of main configuration
file <./conf/spamscope.example.yml>`__. The default value where
SpamScope will search the configuration file is
``/etc/spamscope/spamscope.yml``, but it’s possible to set the
environment variable ``SPAMSCOPE_CONF_FILE``:

::

   $ export SPAMSCOPE_CONF_FILE=/etc/spamscope/spamscope.yml

When you change the configuration file, SpamScope automatically reloads
the new changes.

Installation
============

You can use: \* `Docker images <./docker/README.md>`__ to run SpamScope
with docker engine \* `Ansible <./ansible/README.md>`__: to install and
run SpamScope on server

Topologies
==========

SpamScope comes with six topologies: -
`spamscope_debug <./topologies/spamscope_debug.py>`__: the output are
JSON files on file system. -
`spamscope_elasticsearch <./topologies/spamscope_elasticsearch.py>`__:
the output are stored in Elasticsearch indexes. -
`spamscope_redis <./topologies/spamscope_redis.py>`__: the output are
stored in Redis. -
`spamscope_debug_iter <./topologies/spamscope_debug_iter.py>`__: It uses
generator to send mails in topology. The output are JSON files on file
system. -
`spamscope_elasticsearch_iter <./topologies/spamscope_elasticsearch_iter.py>`__:
It uses generator to send mails in topology. The output are stored in
Elasticsearch indexes. -
`spamscope_redis_iter <./topologies/spamscope_redis_iter.py>`__: It uses
generator to send mails in topology. The output are stored in Redis.

If you want submit SpamScope topology use ``spamscope-topology submit``
tool. For more details `see SpamScope cli tools <src/cli/README.md>`__:

::

   $ spamscope-topology submit --topology {spamscope_debug,spamscope_elasticsearch,spamscope_redis}

It’s possible to change the default settings for all Apache Storm
options. I suggest to change these options:

-  **topology.tick.tuple.freq.secs**: reload configuration of all bolts
-  **topology.max.spout.pending**: Apache Storm framework will then
   throttle your spout as needed to meet the
   ``topology.max.spout.pending`` requirement
-  **topology.sleep.spout.wait.strategy.time.ms**: max sleep for emit
   new tuple (mail)

You can use ``spamscope-topology submit`` to do these changes.

Important
=========

If you are using Elasticsearch output, I suggest you to use
`Elasticsearch templates <./conf/templates>`__ that comes with
SpamScope.

Unittest
========

SpamScope comes with unittests for each modules. In bolts and spouts
there are no special features, all intelligence is in external modules.
All unittests are in `tests folder <tests/>`__.

To have complete tests you should set the followings enviroment
variables:

::

   $ export THUG_ENABLED=True
   $ export VIRUSTOTAL_ENABLED=True
   $ export VIRUSTOTAL_APIKEY="your key"
   $ export ZEMANA_ENABLED=True
   $ export ZEMANA_APIKEY="your key"
   $ export ZEMANA_PARTNERID="your partner id"
   $ export ZEMANA_USERID="your userid"
   $ export SHODAN_ENABLED=True
   $ export SHODAN_APIKEY="your key"
   $ export SPAMASSASSIN_ENABLED=True

Output example
==============

This is a `raw email <https://goo.gl/wMBfbF>`__ that I analyzed with
SpamScope: - `SpamScope output <https://goo.gl/fr4i7C>`__.

This is another example with `Thug analysis <https://goo.gl/Y4kWCv>`__.
