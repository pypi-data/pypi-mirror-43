**windbell is still under early development. Issues or pull requests are welcome!**

# Best Practice

**windbell** requires no system or user level configuration, and produce nothing after installation either. All you need is a **windfile**. So, you could just place it to where you need, then run `windbell send`.

If you want to send email in a CI pipeline of a git repo, you could just place your windfile in the root of your repo, then use a windbell docker to send the email. Windbell officially provide instructions for [Drone CI](https://drone.io).


# Usage

pip install windbell
