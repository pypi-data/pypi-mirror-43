        # Best Practice
        
        **windbell** requires no system or user level configuration, and produce nothing after installation either. All you need is a `windfile`. So, you could just place it to where you need, then run `windbell send`.
        
        If you want to send email in a CI pipeline of a git repo, you could just place your windfile in the root of your repo, then use a windbell docker to send the email. Windbell officially provide instructions for [Drone CI](https://drone.io).
        
        
        # Usage
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install windbell
        ```
        
        ## Start Your Project
        
        ```bash
        windbell init
        ```
        
        `init` command will create a `windfile` in current working dictronary. A `windfile` is the key to your email delivery workflow, it contains email template and configurations.
        
        ```bash
        windbell dev
        ```
        
        `dev` command allows you develop your email project in the browser under a flexible intergrated environment. More detailed structure about `windfile` please refer to doc.
        
        ```bash
        windbell send
        ```
        
        `send` command will read the `windfile` at current dictionary and send to the receviers defined in `windfile`.
