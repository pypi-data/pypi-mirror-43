        Alternative Python bindings for GNU Readline
        --------------------------------------------
        
        Overview
        ============
        
        The `GNU Readline Library`_ is the canonical implementation of command line
        editing, tab completion, and history for console-based applications.
        It is developed as part of Bash and available on virtually any platform.
        
        While Python ships with readline bindings in its standard library, they
        only implement a subset of readline's features, just enough to perform
        identifier completion at the Python interpreter prompt.
        
        The **rl** package aims to provide full implementations of GNU Readline's
        `Custom Completer`_ and `History`_ interfaces.
        It also contains high-level APIs to better organize the namespace and
        shield applications from low-level verbosity.

        Package Contents
        ================
        
        rl exports these components:
        
        completer
            Interface to the readline completer. Used to configure the completion
            aspects of readline.
        
        completion
            Interface to the active readline completion. Used to interact
            with readline when a completion is in progress.
        
        history
            Interface to the readline history. Used to read and write history files
            and to manipulate history entries.
        
        readline
            The readline bindings module. Contains everything known from the standard
            library plus extensions specific to the rl package.  The *completer*,
            *completion*, and *history* interfaces make use of this module, and you
            should rarely need to interact with it directly.
        
        generator
            A factory turning any callable into a *completion entry function* that
            can be handed to readline.
        
        print_exc
            A decorator printing exceptions to stderr. Useful when writing Python
            completions and hooks, as exceptions occurring there are usually
            swallowed by the in-between C code.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        
        For further details please refer to the `API Documentation`_.
        
        .. _`API Documentation`: https://rl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        rl development is hosted on GitHub_ where it also has an `issue tracker`_.

        Installation
        ============
        
        rl requires Python 2.7 or higher. The installer builds GNU Readline 8.0
        and a Python extension module.
        
        On Mac OS X make sure you have Xcode Tools installed. Open a Terminal
        window and type::
        
            gcc --version
        
        You either see some output (good) or an installer window pops up. Click
        the "Install" button to install the command line developer tools.
        A more detailed tutorial is available from `RailsApps`_.
        
        On Linux and BSD systems you probably already have a C compiler, but you may
        need to verify the development environment is complete.
        For example, Ubuntu lacks the Python headers by default and base Fedora is
        missing some compiler configuration. Lastly, readline needs a termcap library
        to link to.
        
        .. _`RailsApps`: https://railsapps.github.io/xcode-command-line-tools.html
        
        Ubuntu/Debian::
        
            sudo apt install build-essential
            sudo apt install python3-dev
            sudo apt install libtinfo-dev
        
        Redhat/Fedora::
        
            sudo dnf install gcc
            sudo dnf install redhat-rpm-config
            sudo dnf install ncurses-devel
        
        Then type::
        
            pip install rl

        - Fix memory leaks in ``py_remove_history``, ``py_replace_history``, and
          ``py_clear_history`` which can occur when history entries are edited.
          See Python `issue 12186`_.
          [stefan]

        -----------------
        
        - Update README, API documentation, and examples.
          [stefan]
        
        - MacPython detection caught other framework builds as well.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.10 - 2010-05-05
        -----------------
        
        - Rework the history interface: Implement iteration and remove redundant APIs.

        1.6 - 2010-03-07
        ----------------
        
        - The history size can now be limited ("stifled") by setting
          ``history.max_entries``. This supersedes ``history.length`` which has been
          removed.
          [stefan]
        
        - Close a memory leak in ``get_current_history_length``. Also see Python

        ------------------
        
        - Work around segfaults under Python 3 on Linux, which are caused by bad or
          missing codecs. This restricts Linux to UTF-8 and Latin-1 locales only.
          Also see rl `issue/5`_.
          [stefan]

        1.4.1 - 2010-02-13
        ------------------
        
        - Fix GPL trove classifier.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.4 - 2010-02-13
        ----------------

          [stefan]
        
        
        1.1 - 2009-11-16
        ----------------
        
        - Remove all occurrences of old-style function typedefs to silence
          compiler warnings.
          [stefan]
        
        - Make the ``display_matches_hook`` work in Python 2.5. Fixes rl `issue/1`_.
          [stefan]
        
        - No longer auto-refresh the prompt at the end of ``display_match_list``.
          Applications should call ``redisplay(force=True)`` to restore the prompt.
          [stefan]
        
        .. _`issue/1`: https://github.com/stefanholek/rl/issues#issue/1
        
        
        1.0 - 2009-11-08
        ----------------
        
        - No changes since 1.0a8.
        
        
        1.0a8 - 2009-11-07
        ------------------
        
        - Close a memory leak in ``word_break_hook``. Three cheers for Xcode's
          ``leaks`` tool.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.0a7 - 2009-11-05
        ------------------
        
        - Rename ``_readline`` module to ``readline`` since it's not private.
          [stefan]
        
        - Remove ``dump`` and ``read_key`` APIs from public interfaces.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.0a6 - 2009-10-30
        ------------------
        
        - Unclutter the ``completer`` interface by removing settings that can
          just as well be made with ``parse_and_bind``.
          [stefan]
        
        - Fix a memory leak in ``username_completion_function`` and
          ``filename_completion_function``.
          [stefan]
        
        - Add a custom epydoc stylesheet to make its reST rendering more pleasant.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.0a5 - 2009-10-29
        ------------------
        
        - Make all ``completion`` properties writable. While not useful in
          production, this allows us to write better tests.
          [stefan]
        
        - Improve API documentation and add a call graph for the completion
          process. This goes a long way in explaining how readline completion
          works.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.0a4 - 2009-10-27
        ------------------
        
        - Implement the ``generator`` factory using an iterator instead of a list.
          [stefan]
        
        - Remove ``find_completion_word`` so people don't get ideas.
          [stefan]
        
        - Don't list distribute as dependency, setuptools will do the
          right thing.
          [stefan]
