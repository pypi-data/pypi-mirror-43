# ChemLG – A Molecular and Materials Library Generator for the Enumeration and Exploration of Chemical Space
ChemLG is a smart and massive parallel molecular library generator for chemical and materials sciences.

Program Version: 0.2

Release Date: Feb 20, 2019

With contributions by:
Janhavi Abhay Dudwadkar (UB): Jupyter GUI

## Code Design:
ChemLG is developed in the Python 3 programming language and uses OpenBabel and its Python extension, Pybel for handling molecules. The development follows a strictly modular and object-oriented design to make the overall code as flexible and versatile as possible.

## Documentation:
ChemLG documentation can be found here https://hachmannlab.github.io/chemlg

## Installation and Dependencies:
The dependencies for ChemLG are OpenBabel and MPI4Py. It is recommended that these two dependencies are installed in a virtual environment prior to installing ChemLG. We suggest the following conda installations:


    conda create --name my_chemlg_env python=3.6
    source activate my_chemlg_env
    conda install -c openbabel openbabel
    conda install -c anaconda mpi4py

You can download ChemLG from Python Package Index (PyPI) via pip. 

    pip install chemlg


You can test the installation with:

    pytest -v
