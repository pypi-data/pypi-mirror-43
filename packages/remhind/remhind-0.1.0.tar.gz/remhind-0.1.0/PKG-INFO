Description: # remhind
        
        A notification daemon of events stored in directories
        
        Those directories will be monitored for change in order to allow you to use
        solution like [vdirsyncer](https://github.com/pimutils/vdirsyncer) to sync your
        CalDAV server with your local filesystem.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        `remhind` use a [toml](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) configuration file
        indicating which directories holds your event files. Here's a simple example:
        
        ```
        [calendars]
            [calendars.test]
            name = "Test"
            path = "~/projets/perso/remhind/test_calendar"
        ```
        
        ## Installing
        
        `remhind` can be installed through PyPI using pip.
