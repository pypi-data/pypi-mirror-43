        # Install
        ```
        pip install feature_selector
        ```
        
        # Methods
        
        There are five methods used to identify features to remove:
        
        1. Missing Values
        2. Single Unique Values
        3. Collinear Features
        4. Zero Importance Features
        5. Low Importance Features 
        
        ## Usage
        
        Refer to the [Feature Selector Usage notebook](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/feature-selector/blob/master/Feature%20Selector%20Usage.ipynb) for how to use
        
        ## Visualizations
        
        The `FeatureSelector` also includes a number of visualization methods to inspect 
        characteristics of a dataset.
