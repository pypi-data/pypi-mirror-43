# SuperMinHash, Simhash and SimhashIndex

## SuperMinHash

A New Minwise Hashing Algorithm for Jaccard Similarity Estimation

This is an implementation of [Otmar Ertl's paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05698.pdf) with the same title.
The implementation is still in progress but almost there...

It is fork to Python from Go (source https://github.com/seiflotfy/superminhash)

## Simhash and SimhashIndex

It is fork and redesign (source https://github.com/leonsim/simhash)
