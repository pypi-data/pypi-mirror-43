Description: # SuperMinHash, Simhash and SimhashIndex
        
        ## SuperMinHash
        
        A New Minwise Hashing Algorithm for Jaccard Similarity Estimation
        
        This is an implementation of [Otmar Ertl's paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05698.pdf) with the same title.
        The implementation is still in progress but almost there...
        
        It is fork to Python from Go (source https://github.com/seiflotfy/superminhash)
        
        ## Simhash and SimhashIndex
        
        It is fork and redesign (source https://github.com/leonsim/simhash)
