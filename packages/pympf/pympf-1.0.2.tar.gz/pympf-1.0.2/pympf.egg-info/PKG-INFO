Description: # PyMPF
        This is an arbitrary precision IEEE-754 floating point implementation.
        
        The main motivation is correctness and test-case generation, so a
        number of things might seem a bit strange. This library has a bunch of
        limitations and should never be used if you want things to be
        fast. MPFR, SymFPU or Z3's MPF library are what you want.
        
        Why "yet another" implementation?
          - This library supports RNA (MPFR does not)
          - This library supports subnormals and infinities (MPFR does, but only with tricks)
          - This library uses IEEE or SMTLIB terminology where possible (unlike MPFR)
          - This library is done completely in Python unlike gmpy, mpmath, etc.
          - This library is an independent implementation so can be used to check Z3/CVC4
          - This library uses a stupid but simple algorithm to do rounding
        
        The main use of this library is random test-case generation for
        SMT-LIB. It has been used to validate the FP implementations of CVC4,
        Z3, MathSAT, SONOLAR, Alt-Ergo, Colibri, goSAT, and xsat; and has
        found bugs in all of them ;)
