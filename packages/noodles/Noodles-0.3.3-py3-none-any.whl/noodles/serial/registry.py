    The Registry keeps a dictionary mapping (qualified) class names to

    method looks for the highest base class that it has a serialiser for.
    As a fall-back we install a Serialiser matching the Python
    `object` class.

    Detection by object type is not always meaningful or even possible.
    Before scannning for known base classes the look-up function passes
    the object through the `hook` function, which should return a string
    or `None`. If a string is returned that string is used to look-up
    the serialiser.

    Registries can be combined using the '+' operator. The left side argument
    is than used as `parent` to the new Registry, while the right-hand argument
    overrides and augments the Serialisers present. The `hook` functions
    are being chained, such that the right-hand registry takes precedence.
    The default serialiser is inherrited from the left-hand argument.
