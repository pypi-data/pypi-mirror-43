        zestreleaser.towncrier
        ======================
        
        This calls `towncrier <https://github.com/hawkowl/towncrier>`_ when releasing a package with `zest.releaser <http://zestreleaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
        ``towncrier`` updates your history file (like ``CHANGES.rst``) based on news snippets.
        This is for example `used by pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/development/#adding-a-news-entry>`_.
        
        The plugin will call ``towncrier --version <package version> --yes``.
        You can get a preview of the result yourself by calling ``towncrier --version 1.2.3 --draft``.
        
        The ``towncrier`` command should be on your ``PATH``.
        The plugin can also find it when it is in the same directory as the ``fullrelease`` script (or ``prerelease/postrelease``).
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install ``zestreleaser.towncrier`` with ``pip``::
        
            $ pip install zestreleaser.towncrier
        
        Then you can run ``fullrelease`` like you would normally do when releasing a package.

        ``pyproject.toml`` example
        --------------------------
        
        ``towncrier`` needs a configured ``pyproject.toml`` file in the root of the package, next to the ``setup.py``.
        For reference, here is the literal ``pyproject.toml`` file from ``zestreleaser.towncrier``::
        
          [tool.towncrier]
          issue_format = "`Issue #{issue} <https://github.com/collective/zestreleaser.towncrier/issues/{issue}>`_"
          filename = "CHANGES.rst"
          directory = "news/"
          title_format = "{version} ({project_date})"
          # First underline is used for version/date header.
          # Second underline is used for the type names (like 'Bug fixes:').
          underlines = ["-", ""]
          
          [[tool.towncrier.type]]
          directory = "breaking"
          name = "Breaking changes:"
          showcontent = true
          
          [[tool.towncrier.type]]
          directory = "feature"
          name = "New features:"
          showcontent = true
          
          [[tool.towncrier.type]]
          directory = "bugfix"
          name = "Bug fixes:"
          showcontent = true
