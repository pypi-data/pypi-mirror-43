		<h1>Custom Profile Editor</h1>
		<p>The profile editor allows for the voxel model to be edited from any angle the side. A custom profile is added by manually entering in coordinates. Simply select a lithology and draw the model in, as you would in a paint program. Changing the profile allows for the drawing in of lithologies at different custom locations.</p>
		<h2>Options</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Profile - allows for the selection of the profile being modelled. A slider provides convenient setting of this parameter.</li>
			<li>Dataset Drop Box - Allows for a vertical image to be faded in and out of the layer with the aid of a slider. This can help when you need to know where the boundaries of geological units are. The image is specially imported using 'Import Profile Picture' from the 'Potential Field Modelling' Menu on the main PyGMI interface.</li>			<li>Lithology List - Use this to select which lithology that you are currently drawing. To erase, simply select the Background lithology and draw with that.</li>
			<li>Line Thickness - This allows you to change the pen thickness, which you are drawing with.</li>
			<li>Profile Y-Axis Scale - This changes the scale of the Y-Axis. This can be important after performing a calculation, to see the full effect of the calculation.</li>
			<li>Add Custom Profile - Manually anter the coordinates for the custom profile</li>
			<li>Export Profile - Export an X,Y,Z file of the profile data.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Calculations</h2>
		<p>Calculations  can be done by choosing one of two options from the menu bar at the top of the program:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Regional Test - This is used to display a graph showing the regional decay of your model. It is a fast way to see if either your model extents are large enough, or how the calculated field would fall off near the end of your model.</li>
			<li>Calculate Gravity - This calculates the gravity at the height specified in the Geophysical Parameters Tab.</li>
			<li>Calculate Magnetics - This is used if you want Magnetic data. The height chosen is the magnetic height.</li>
		</ul>
