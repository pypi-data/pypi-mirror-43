A simple Pythonic interface for `libsoundio <http://libsound.io>`_.

libsoundio is a robust, cross-platform solution for real-time audio. It performs
no buffering or processing on your behalf, instead exposing the raw power of the
underlying backend.


Dependencies
------------

* macOS ::

    brew install libsoundio

* Ubuntu / Debian ::

    apt-get install libsoundio-dev

* Windows

    - Download binaries from `libsound.io <http://libsound.io>`_
    - Copy the contents of the download into a folder at ``C:\\ProgramData\libsoundio``

Some Ubuntu distributions link to an older version of libsoundio,
so to use the latest version you will need to install from `source <http://libsound.io/#releases>`_.
