def isosteric_heat(isotherms, loading_points=None, branch='ads', verbose=False):
    r"""
    Calculate the isosteric heat of adsorption using several isotherms
    recorded at different temperatures on the same material.

    Parameters
    ----------
    isotherms : iterable of Isotherms
        The isotherms to use in calculation of the isosteric heat. They should all
        be measured on the same material.
    loading_points : array, optional
        The loading points at which the isosteric heat should be calculated. Take care,
        as the points must be within the range of loading of all passed isotherms, or
        else the calculation cannot complete.
    branch : str
        The branch of the isotherms to take, defaults to adsorption branch.
    verbose : bool
        Whether to print out extra information and generate a graph.

    Returns
    -------
    result_dict : dict
        A dictionary with the isosteric heats per loading, with the form:

            - ``isosteric_heat`` (array) : the isosteric heat of adsorption in kj/mmol
            - ``loading`` (array) : the loading for each point of the isosteric heat, in mmol

    Notes
    -----

    *Description*

    The isosteric heats are calculated from experimental data using the Clausius-Clapeyron
    equation as the starting point:

    .. math::

        \Big( \frac{\partial \ln P}{\partial T} \Big)_{n_a} = -\frac{\Delta H_{ads}}{R T^2}

    Where :math:`\Delta H_{ads}` is the enthalpy of adsorption. In order to approximate the
    partial differential, two or more isotherms are measured at different temperatures. The
    assumption made is that the heat of adsorption does not vary in the temperature range
    chosen. Therefore, the isosteric heat of adsorption can be calculated by using the pressures
    at which the loading is identical using the following equation for each point:

    .. math::

        \Delta H_{ads} = - R \frac{\partial \ln P}{\partial 1 / T}

    and plotting the values of :math:`\ln P` against :math:`1 / T` we should obtain a straight
    line with a slope of :math:`- \Delta H_{ads} / R.`

    *Limitations*

    The isosteric heat is sensitive to the differences in pressure between the two isotherms. If
    the isotherms measured are too close together, the error margin will increase.

    The method also assumes that enthalpy of adsorption does not vary with temperature. If the
    variation is large for the system in question, the isosteric heat calculation will give
    unrealistic values.

    Even with carefully measured experimental data, there are two assumptions used in deriving
    the Clausius-Clapeyron equation: an ideal bulk gas phase and a negligible adsorbed phase
    molar volume. These have a significant effect on the calculated isosteric heats of adsorption,
    especially at high relative pressures and for heavy adsorbates.

        An array of arrays of pressures for each isotherm, in bar.
        For example, if using two isotherms to calculate the isosteric heat:
