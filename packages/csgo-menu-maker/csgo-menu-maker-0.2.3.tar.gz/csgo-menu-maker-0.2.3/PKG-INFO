        ## About
        
        The Source(TM) engine has a console command system that is extremely powerful when leveraged correctly. I used it to create a system of menus and widgets that allows users to customize their game configuration on-the-fly in terms of things like crosshairs, viewmodels, and HUD looks. 
        
        `csgo-menu-maker` uses a versatile configuration language (spoiler alert: it's yml) which lets users with very little to no coding experience create these menus.
        
        Over the past month of writing this, I learned a lot about Python, [source console scripting,](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Developer_Console),\ and [tracking down bugs that are older than I am.](https://git.io/fhj0O) In the process of discovering my own and Valve's bugs, I may have left a few in this project, so don't be too hard on me.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Here's a glimpse into the language used to make these menus. For example, to create the demo menu above:
        
        ```
        tree:
            Crosshairs:
                type: config.crosshairs
                presets:
                    General:
                        color: [0, 255, 255]
                    Pistol Rounds:
                        color: [0, 255, 0]
                        t_shape: 1
                        dot: 1
            Viewmodels:
                type: config.viewmodels
                presets:
                    Regular:
                        offset: [2.5, 0, -1.5]
                        fov: 60
                    Gangster:
                        offset: [1.5, 2, 2]
                        fov: 68
            HUDs:
                type: config.huds
                presets:
                    Regular:
                        scale: 0.9
                    Navigator:
                        radar_rotate: 0
                        radar_icon_scale: 0.8
            Master Volume: sound.volume.master
        ```

        ```
        pip install pyyaml csgo-menu-maker
        ```
