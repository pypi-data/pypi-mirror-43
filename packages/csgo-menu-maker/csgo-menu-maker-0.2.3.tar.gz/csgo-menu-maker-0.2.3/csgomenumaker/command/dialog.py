        # The commands are nested in an Indirect, because of a fucking stupid
        # parsing bug in the Source engine. Valve, please fix. Actually do,
        # though, because this bug goes all the way back to FUCKING QUAKE with
        # the concmd system. SERIOUSLY!!!
        # A description of the bug is as follows.

        # The Source engine is derived from the GoldSrc engine. The GoldSrc
        # engine is derived from Quake (1996), albeit with heavy modification.
        # Thus, there is some residual code from Quake in the Source engine.
        # No problem, Quake was a great game, id software is amazing (shoutout
        # to JC), the code was state-of-the-art for back then. However, now, it
        # is not state-of-the-art. Namely, the lack of special character
        # support is at fault here. It is my impression that Quake was an ASCII
        # only game (totally fine for '96), and thus unicode or wchar_t most
        # likely were not compatible with the codebase. To put that whole thing
        # in perspective, Quake (22 years old, as of 2019) is six years older
        # than I am.
        # Let's walk through the code leading up to this. Follow along at:
        # https://github.com/ValveSoftware/source-sdk-2013/blob/master/sp/src/tier1/commandbuffer.cpp
        # Ignore the spelling error on line 423 (literally unreadable)
        # Valve has deliberately #if'd out the section of this file that was
        # derived from Quake, but it's still used in CS:GO, for sure; the
        # error messages and alias command syntax is EXACTLY the same.
        # Aliases are stored in `cmdalias_t`, which is a simple linked-list
        # node (meaning aliases are searched O(n)). The contents of the alias
        # are stored as char*, which is perplexing because char* should be able
        # to handle Unicode strings JUST FINE. It was my impression that there
        # is some kind of mangling going on by CCommandBuffer or the command
        # system as a whole that's converting Unicode to some kind of invalid
        # character placeholder. The manifestation of this bug is that if you
        # place special characters (Unicode or otherwise) in a cmd statement
        # in an alias command it will display ?s for each character making up
        # the Unicode codepoint (sorry if I used the wrong terminology).
        # For example:
        # ```
        # alias test_echo_unicode="echo ℽ"
        #
        # ] test_echo_unicode
        # ? ? ?
        # ```
        # But when running this:
        # ```
        # ] echo ℽ
        # ℽ
        # ```
        # It works fine???
        # Mysteriously, this bug does not show up when you are executing
        # commands normally, i.e. from the console or from a .cfg. What gives??
        # I would trace it further, but I decided it wasn't worth it after 3+
        # hours of searching, especially as I would have no way of fixing it.

        # Anyway, the outcome of this is that each set of echo commands must be
        # put inside a separate .cfg file. Pretty gnarly. However, it was fun
        # to poke around the Source codebase. Regardless of how weird its
        # organization is, the engine is remarkable and is one of the easiest
        # engines to understand, as well as the company being relatively
        # developer friendly. Thanks Valve!
