This is a simple, easily extendible soap library that provides several useful
tools for creating and publishing soap web services in python.  This package
features on-demand wsdl generation for the published services, a
wsgi-compliant web application, support for complex class structures, binary
attachments, simple framework for creating additional serialization mechanisms
and a client library.

This prokect now uses lxml as it's XML API, providing full namespace support.
