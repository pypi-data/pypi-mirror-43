``ukbparse`` changelog
======================


0.14.6 (Saturday 16th March 2019)
---------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed a ``KeyError`` which was occurring during the child-value replacement
  stage for input files which did not have column names of the form
  ``[variable]-[visit].[instance]``.
* Fixed some issues introduced by behavioural changes in the
  ``pandas.HDFStore`` class.


0.14.5 (Thursday 17th January 2019)
-----------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Implemented a workaround for a `bug <https://bugs.python.org/issue9334>`_ in
  the Python ``argparse`` module.


0.14.4 (Friday 11th January 2019)
---------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Updated the default processing rules for variable
  [1120-1150](https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/field.cgi?id=1120).


0.14.3 (Tuesday 8th January 2019)
---------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed a regression introduced in 0.14.2, where column loading restrictions
  (e.g. ``--variable``) were not being honoured


0.14.2 (Monday 7th January 2019)
--------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed a regression introduced in 0.14.1, where using the ``--variable`` and
  ``--visit`` options together could cause a crash.


0.14.1 (Monday 7th January 2019)
--------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* If the index columns for each input file have different names, the output
  index column was unnamed.  It is now given the name of the index column in
  the first input file.
* When the ``--column`` and ``--variable`` options were used together, only
  columns which passed both tests were being loaded. Now, columns which pass
  either test are loaded.


0.14.0 (Tuesday 25th December 2018)
-----------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* New ``--column`` option, allowing columns to be selected by name/name
  pattern.
* ``ukbparse`` can now be installed from `conda-forge
  <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ukbparse>`_.


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The index column in the output file no longer defaults to being named
  ``'eid'``. It defaults to the name of the index in the input file, but
  can still be overridden by the ``--output_id_column`` option.


Fixed
^^^^^


* Blank lines are now allowed in configuration files (#2)
* Fix to derived column names for ICD10 variables in default processing rules.


0.13.1 (Thursday 20th December 2018)
------------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* Unit test to make sure that ``ukbparse`` crashes if given bad input
  arguments.


0.13.0 (Thursday 20th Deember 2018)
-----------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* New ``--index`` option, allowing the position of the index column in input
  files to be specified.
* The ``--variable``, ``--subject``, and ``--exclude`` options now accept
  comma-separated lists, in addition to IDs, ID ranges, and text files.


Fixed
^^^^^


* Memory usage estimates in log messages were wrong under Linux.


0.12.3 (Tuesday 18th December 2018
----------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Changes to new :func:`.fileinfo.has_header` function to improve robustness.


0.12.2 (Monday 17th December 2018)
----------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Now using a custom implementation of ``csv.Sniffer.has_header``, as the
  standard library version does not handle some scenarios.


0.12.1 (Saturday 15th December 2018)
------------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* Added some instructions for generating your own variable and data coding
  tables to the README.


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The ``ukbparse_demo`` script ensures that the Jupyter ``bash_kernel`` is
  installed.
* The ``ukbparse_compare_tables``, ``ukbparse_htmlparse`` and
  ``ukbparse_join`` scripts print some help documentation when called without
  any arguments.
* Added ``lxml`` as a dependency (required by ``beautifulsoup4``).


0.12.0 (Tuesday 11th December 2018)
-----------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* The ``join``, ``compare_tables``, and ``htmlparse`` scripts are now
  installed as entry points called ``ukbparse_join``,
  ``ukbparse_compare_tables``, and ``ukbparse_htmlparse``.
* Jupyter notebook, demonstrating most of the features in ``ukbparse``, at
  ``ukbparse/demo/ukbparse_demonstration.ipynb``. You can run the demo via the
  ``ukbparse_demo`` entry point.


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Moved the ``scripts/`` directory into the ``ukbparse/`` directory.
* Improved string representation of process functions.


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fix to configuration file parsing code - ``shlex.split`` is now used instead
  of ``str.split``.
* Fixed mixed data type issues when merging the data coding and type tables into
  the variable table.


0.11.3 (Monday 10th December 2018)
----------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Made the ``vid``, ``visit``, and ``instance`` parameters to the
  :class:`.Column` class optional, to make life easier for custom sniffer
  functions.


0.11.2 (Monday 10th December 2018)
----------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed a bug in the handling of new variable IDs returned by processing
  functions.

0.11.0 (Monday 10th December 2018)
----------------------------------


Added
^^^^^


* New ``--no_builtins`` option, which causes the built-in variable, data
  coding, type, and category table files to be bypassed.
* New :meth:`.PluginRegistry.get` function for getting a reference to a plugin
  function.
* Cleaning/processing functions are listed in command-line help.


0.10.5 (Saturday 8th December 2018)
-----------------------------------


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The ``minpres`` option to the :func:`.removeIfSparse` processing function
  is ignored if it is specified as an absolute value, and the data set length
  is less than it.


0.10.4 (Friday 7th December 2018)
---------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed an issue with the `--subject` command line option.


0.10.3 (Friday 7th December 2018)

---------------------------------


Fixed
^^^^^


* Removed relative imports from test modules.


0.10.1 (Friday 7th December 2018)

Added
^^^^^


* New ``--na_values``, ``--recoding``, and ``--child_values`` command-line

-----


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed a bug in the :func:`.icd10.saveCodes` function.


0.7.0
-----

0.6.3
-----


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Minor updates to avoid deprecation warnings.


0.6.2
-----


Fixed
^^^^^


* Fixed a bug with the ``--import_all`` option, where an error would be thrown
  if a specifically requested variable was removed during processing.


0.6.1
-----


Changed
^^^^^^^


* Changed default processing for variables 41202/41204 so they are binarised
  *within* visit.

-----


Added
^^^^^


* New ``--import_all`` and ``--unknown_vars_file`` options for outputting
  information about previously unknown variables/columns.

Added
^^^^^


* Ability to export a mapping file containing the numeric values that ICD10

  Sparsity/redundancy tests happen at the end, so that columns generated by
  previous steps are tested.


Fixed
^^^^^


* :meth:`.HDFStoreCollection.loc` method returns a ``pandas.DataFrame`` when
  a list of columns are indexed, and a ``pandas.Series`` when a single column
  is indexed.

* Updates to variable table for UKBiobank spirometry variables.


0.4.0
-----


Added

^^^^^^^

Changed
^^^^^^^


* Reverted the behaviour of :func:`.isSparse`.


0.3.2
-----


Changed
^^^^^^^

  than* the ``minpres`` threshold pass, rather than *greater than or equal
  to*.


0.3.1
-----


Changed
^^^^^^^


* The :func:`.isSparse` function ignores the ``minpres`` argument if it
  is larger than the number of samples in the data set.


Fixed
^^^^^


* The :func:`.binariseCategorical` function now works on data with missing
  values.

^^^^^


* New :meth:`.DataTable.addColumns` method, so processing functions can
  now add new columns.

  categorical column into multiple binary columns, one for each unique
  value in the data.
* New :func:`.expandCompound` processing function, which expands a
