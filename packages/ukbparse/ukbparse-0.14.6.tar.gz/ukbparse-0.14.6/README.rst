``ukbparse`` is a Python library for pre-processing of UK BioBank data.


Installation
------------


Install ``ukbparse`` via pip::


    pip install ukbparse


Or from ``conda-forge``::

    conda install -c conda-forge ukbparse


Comprehensive documentation does not yet exist.


Introductory notebook
---------------------


The ``ukbparse_demo`` command will start a Jupyter Notebook which introduces
the main features provided by ``ukbparse``. To run it, you need to install a
few additional dependencies::


    pip install ukbparse[demo]


You can then start the demo by running ``ukbparse_demo``.


.. note:: The introductory notebook uses ``bash``, so is unlikely to work on
          Windows.


Usage
-----


General usage is as follows::


    ukbparse [options] output.tsv input1.tsv input2.tsv


You can get information on all of the options by typing ``ukbparse --help``.


Options can be specified on the command line, and/or stored in a configuration
file. For example, the options in the following command line::


    ukbparse \
      --overwrite \
      --import_all \
      --log_file log.txt \
      --icd10_map_file icd_codes.tsv \
      --category 10 \
      --category 11 \
      output.tsv input1.tsv input2.tsv


Could be stored in a configuration file ``config.txt``::


    overwrite
    import_all
    log_file       log.txt
    icd10_map_file icd_codes.tsv
    category       10
    category       11


And then executed as follows::


    ukbparse -cfg config.txt output.tsv input1.tsv input2.tsv


Customising
-----------


``ukbparse`` contains a large number of built-in rules which have been
specifically written to pre-process UK BioBank data variables. These rules are
stored in the following files:


 * ``ukbparse/data/variables.tsv``: Cleaning rules for individual variables
 * ``ukbparse/data/datacodings.tsv``: Cleaning rules for data codings
 * ``ukbparse/data/types.tsv``: Cleaning rules for specific types
 * ``ukbparse/data/processing.tsv``: Processing steps

You can customise or replace these files as you see fit. You can also pass
your own versions of these files to ``ukbparse`` via the ``--variable_file``,
``--datacoding_file``, ``--type_file`` and ``--processing_file`` command-line
options respectively.

The ``variables.tsv`` file defines all of the variables that ``ukbparse`` is
aware of.  If your UK BioBank data set contains variables which are not listed
in this file, you may wish to generate your own version - you can do so
by following these steps:

1. Use the ``ukbconv`` utility (available through the `BioBank Data showcase
   <http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/>`_) to generate a HTML file
   describing all of the variables in your data set, and data codings used by
   them.

2. Use the ``ukbparse_htmlparse`` command to convert this ``html`` file into
   variable and data coding "base" files, which just contain the meta-data
   for each variable/data coding.

3. Code up your custom cleaning rules for each variable and data coding, in
   the same format as can be seen in the ``ukbparse/data/`` directory. For
   data codings, create these flies:

     * ``datacodings_navalues.tsv``: contains NA value replacement rules
     * ``datacodings_recoding.tsv``: contains categorical recoding rules

   And for variables, create these files:

     * ``variables_navalues.tsv``: Contains NA value replacement rules
     * ``variables_recoding.tsv``: Contains categorical recoding rules
     * ``variables_clean.tsv``: Contains variable-specific cleaning functions
     * ``variables_parentvalues.tsv``: Contains child value replacement rules.

4. Use the ``ukbparse_join`` command to generate the final variable and data
   coding tables from your base files, e.g.::

     ukbparse_join final_variables_table.tsv \
                   variables_base.tsv \
                   variables_navalues.tsv \
                   variables_recoding.tsv \
                   variables_parentvalues.tsv \
                   variables_clean.tsv
     ukbparse_join final_datacodings.tsv \
                   datacodings_base.tsv \
                   datacodings_navalues.tsv \
                   datacodings_recoding.tsv


Tests
-----


To run the test suite, you need to install some additional dependencies::


      pip install ukbparse[test]


Then you can run the test suite using ``pytest``::

    pytest
