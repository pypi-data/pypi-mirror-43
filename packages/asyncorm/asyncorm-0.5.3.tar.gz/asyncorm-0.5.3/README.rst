A fully asynchronous python ORM

* Free software: Apache Software License 2.0
* Documentation: https://asyncorm.readthedocs.io.


Features
--------

WARNING: alpha version !!

WARNING: Work In Progress !!

**AsyncORM** is a fully async ORM_ inspired by the fantastic `django orm`_

.. _ORM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping
.. _django orm: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/

**AsyncORM** currently only supports postgres, but its developed to be "easy"
to plug a number of different database interfaces.

It is designed to be used with any async library, but with sanic_ in mind.

.. _sanic: https://github.com/channelcat/sanic

To do
-----

A number of things are needed to be able to release asyncOrm as a production
ready ORM:

- better the documentation!
- migration support (forward migration at least)
- other databases interfaces ( `mysql`_ / `mariaDb`_ first priority)
- `prefetch_related`_ functionality
- Missing Field types: OneToOneField

.. _mySql: https://www.mysql.com/
.. _mariaDb: https://mariadb.org/
.. _prefetch_related: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch_related support

Dependencies
------------

AsyncOrm currently only depends on AsyncPg and netaddr.

asyncpg_, is a database interface library designed specifically for PostgreSQL
and Python/asyncio.

netaddr_, A network address manipulation library for Python

.. _asyncpg: https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg
.. _netaddr: https://github.com/drkjam/netaddr
