        Features
        --------
        
        WARNING: version prebeta !!
        
        WARNING: Work In Progress !!
        
        **AsyncORM** is a fully async ORM_ inspired by the fantastic `django orm`_
        
        .. _ORM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping
        .. _django orm: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/db/
        
        **AsyncORM** currently only supports postgres, but its developed to be "easy"
        to plug a number of different database interfaces.
        
        It is designed to be used with any async library, but with sanic_ in mind.
        
        .. _sanic: https://github.com/channelcat/sanic
        
        To do
        -----
        
        A number of things are needed to be able to release asyncOrm as a production
        ready ORM:
        
        - better the documentation!
        - migration support (forward migration at least)
        - other databases interfaces ( `mysql`_ / `mariaDb`_ first priority)
        - `prefetch_related`_ functionality
        - Missing Field types: OneToOneField
        
        .. _mySql: https://www.mysql.com/
        .. _mariaDb: https://mariadb.org/
        .. _prefetch_related: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch_related support
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        AsyncOrm currently only depends on AsyncPg and netaddr.
        
        asyncpg_, is a database interface library designed specifically for PostgreSQL
        and Python/asyncio.
        
        netaddr_, A network address manipulation library for Python
        
        .. _asyncpg: https://github.com/MagicStack/asyncpg
        .. _netaddr: https://github.com/drkjam/netaddr
