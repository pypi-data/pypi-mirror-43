        This library provides a simple asynchronous Python wrapper for the Fast Purge
        API. Features include:
        
        - convenient handling of authentication
        - recovery from errors
        - splitting large requests into smaller pieces
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install the `fastpurge` package from PyPI.
        
        ```
        pip install fastpurge
        ```
        
        Usage Example
        -------------
        
        Assuming a valid `~/.edgerc` file prepared with credentials according to
        Akamai's documentation:
        
        ```python
        from fastpurge import FastPurgeClient
        
        # Omit credentials to read from ~/.edgerc
        client = FastPurgeClient()
        
        # Start purge of some URLs
        purged = client.purge_by_url(['https://example.com/resource1', 'https://example.com/resource2'])
        
        # purged is a Future, if we want to ensure purge completed
        # we can block on the result:
        result = purged.result()
        print("Purge completed:", result)
        ```
