> Hypostomus plecostomus, the suckermouth catfish or common pleco, ('hypo' = under, 'stoma' = mouth, 'pleco'= pleated) is a tropical fish belonging to the armored catfish family (Loricariidae), named for the armor-like longitudinal rows of scutes that cover the upper parts of the head and body. Hypostomus plecostomus is named for its sucker-like mouth, which allows it to adhere to a surface, as well as to hold and rasp at food. This omnivorous species feeds on algae, aquatic plants, and small crustaceans.

## Features 

Plecos contains functions that validate metadata formatted as json according to OEP-8. 
You can validate a single json containg metadata or a list with with multiple links 
which contain metadata. 

## Get Started 

The following online tools are useful when working with JSON and schemas;
https://www.jsonschema.net/
https://jsonlint.com/
http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/

### Quickstart
After installing and importing the package, call the `.is_valid_file(YOUR_JSON_PATH)` function to check a json file against the latest [OEP8 schema](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/OEPs/tree/master/8). 
```python
from pathlib import Path
import plecos

# Get a file path to your metadata.json file
PATH_DATA_ROOT = Path("~/DATA").expanduser()
path_to_json = PATH_DATA_ROOT / 'metadata.json'

# Check if valid, if not - list the error in a summary form
if not plecos.is_valid_file(path_to_json):
    plecos.list_errors_file(path_to_json)
```

A dictionary object can also be checked against the schema, using `.is_valid_dict(python_dictionary)`. 
```python
from pathlib import Path
import plecos
import json

# Get a file path to your metadata.json file
PATH_DATA_ROOT = Path("~/DATA").expanduser()
path_to_json = PATH_DATA_ROOT / 'metadata.json'

# Load it into a dictionary
with open(path_to_json) as json_file:
    this_json_dict = json.load(json_file)
        
# Check if valid, if not - list the error in a summary form
if not plecos.is_valid_dict(this_json_dict):
    plecos.list_errors_dict(this_json_dict)
```

### Summary of functions
Returning True/False;
```python
is_valid_file(python_dict, schema_file=SCHEMA_FILE)
is_valid_dict(json_file_path, schema_file=SCHEMA_FILE)
```

For listing all errors in JSON;
```python
list_errors_file(json_file_path, schema_file=SCHEMA_FILE)
list_errors_dict(python_dict, schema_file=SCHEMA_FILE)
```

Calling [jsonschema](https://pypi.org/project/jsonschema/) more directly, if your API depends on this. 
```python
# Return a jsonschema.Validator object
validator = validator_file(schema_file=SCHEMA_FILE)
validator = validator_dict(python_schema_dict)

# Call jsonschema.validators.Draft7Validator(this_json_schema_dict).validate(this_json_dict)
validate_file(json_file_path, schema_file=SCHEMA_FILE)
validate_dict(python_dict, schema_file=SCHEMA_FILE)
```

*SCHEMA_FILE* points to the latest OEP8 schema. Other versions are included in the package. 

*SCHEMA_FILE* can also be replaced with your own file path to your own schema.
