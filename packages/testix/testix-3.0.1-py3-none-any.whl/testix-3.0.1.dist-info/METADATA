# TESTIX

Testix is a Mocking framework for Python.

## Credit Where it's due
Testix started as a re-implementation of ideas from the Voodoo-Mock unit-testing framework (http://sourceforge.net/projects/voodoo-mock), which also supports C++ unit testing. Check it out. Since then it has evolved some different traits though.

## License

See the COPYING file for details.


## Installation
With `pip`:

    $ pip install testix

## Python 3

Testix has been tried with Python 3, but it may work with Python 2 as well.

## How to use it

TBD - for the time being, look at the examples.

Testix is intended to be used with `unittest`, the standrad Python unit testing framework.
If you clone this repository you can run the examples like so

    $ python3 -m unittest examples/tests/test_*.py

Or, if you have [`rake`](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) you can run

    $ rake examples

Enjoy!
