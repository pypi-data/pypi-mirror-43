Unicode name completions
========================

Previously, we provided completion for a unicode name with its relative symbol.
With this, now IPython provides complete suggestions to unicode name symbols.

As on the PR, if user types ``\LAT<tab>``, IPython provides a list of
possible completions. In this case, it would be something like:

'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A',
'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B',
'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C',
'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D',
....

This help to type unicode character that do not have short latex aliases, and
have long unicode names. for example ``Í°``, ``\GREEK CAPITAL LETTER HETA``.

This feature was contributed by Luciana Marques `ghpull:`#11583`.

Make audio normalization optional
=================================

Added 'normalize' argument to `IPython.display.Audio`. This argument applies
when audio data is given as an array of samples. The default of `normalize=True`
preserves prior behavior of normalizing the audio to the maximum possible range.
Setting to `False` disables normalization.
