# poremks

PoreMKS is a tool for the analytics of nanoporous molecular structures.

Nanoporous materials are defined as materials having pore less than 100 nm
in size which are often comparable to the size of individual molecules.

Nanoporous materials have a series of unique properties, making nanoporous
materials useful for industrially important applications such as gas storage,
separations, catalysis, et cetera. A vast number of unique nanoporous materials
can be synthesized, varying in chemical composition and pore topology. In addition
hundreds of thousand hypothetical materials have been computationally predicted and
a considerable number of computational screening studies have appeared in the
literature that examine the potential of nanoporous materials for a series
of applications.
