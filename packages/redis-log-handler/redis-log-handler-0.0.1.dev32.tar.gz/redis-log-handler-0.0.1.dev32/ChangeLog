* Fixed: Tried to fix the wrong tests ðŸ‘Œ
* Refactored: Use a connectionpool to connect instead

* Updated: README
* Refactored: Use \*\*kwargs in class for redis connection Before we only allowed a small number of ways to connect to a Redis instance, which is why we moved to the \*\*kwargs approach. This way everyone can set up the connection in the way that's needed for their project, rather just using host, port and password
* Refactored: Other options available asides from pure channel publishing. Since our usecase required use to offer new options, a dedicated handler was written for that. This introduces the ability to use a RedisKeyHandler which rpushes every message onto a key. The basehandler was opened up to allow users to implement custom redis commands
