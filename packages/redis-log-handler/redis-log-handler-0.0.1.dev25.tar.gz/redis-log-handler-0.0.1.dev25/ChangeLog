CHANGES
=======

* Refactored: Other options available asides from pure channel publishing. Since our usecase required use to offer new options, a dedicated handler was written for that. This introduces the ability to use a RedisKeyHandler which rpushes every message onto a key. The basehandler was opened up to allow users to implement custom redis commands
