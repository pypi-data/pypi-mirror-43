""" Serialization field spec implementation.

This is what makes the serialization so flexible as it allows to cherry-pick
what is actually serialized. This module just implements the serialization field
specification itself and the rest of the system uses it to define/decide what
is being included in the resulting data.

This module **has** to be really well tested as everything else depends on it
and the implementation itself is a bit tricky.

Usage
=====

**Example field spec**

>>> from serafin import Fieldspec
>>>
>>> fs = Fieldspec('field1,field2(sub1,sub2),field3(*)')
>>> fs
<Fieldspec: field1,field2,field3>

**Easily check if the field is matched by the spec**

>>> 'field1' in fs
True
>>> fs['field1']
True
>>> 'field7' in fs
False

**Supports nested specifications**

>>> fs['field2']
<Fieldspec: sub1,sub2>
>>> 'sub1' in fs['field2']
True
>>> fs['field2']['sub2']
True


**And wildcards**

>>> 'asdf' in fs['field2']
False
>>> 'asdf' in fs['field3']
True
>>> fs['field3']['asdf']
True

**You can exclude fields as well**

>>> fs = Fieldspec('*,-field1')
>>> 'asdf' in fs
True
>>> 'field1' in fs
False

    ``Fieldspec`` represents field specification for REST queries. It describes
    the format in which the query result will be returned. What model fields
    should be present and which of them should be expanded. Expansion works
    for foreign keys, where instead of object key, we can insert the object
    itself (with all, or selected members).

    For usage examples see ``restapi.serialize.serialize()``.

    **Implementation**

    Fieldspec has 2 main variables that hold the spec. The ``fields`` and
    ``exclude``. Exclude is much simpler, because it's just a list of strings
    with field names that should be excluded at this level.

    The ``fields`` member is a list of tuples ``(name, members)`` where name
    is the fields name and members is the optional member spec **members** can
    be one of:

        - None
        - ``True`` if the subfield spec is just the field name, ie ``field``.
        - ``Fieldspec`` if the subfield has a field spec defined, ie
          ``field(sub1,sub2)``.

    If the field spec contains ``*`` it means at that level all fields are
    included by default. You can still exclude them using ``-`` but by default
    all fields within an object are included.

    The special field spec `**` can be used and it means the same thing as ``*``
    but is applied recursively to all objects. **Be very careful** with using it
    as it will try to serialize EVERYTHING and in many cases you will run into
    problems.

    TODO:

        - Merging two specs together (union).
        - Restricting one spec by another (intersection).
