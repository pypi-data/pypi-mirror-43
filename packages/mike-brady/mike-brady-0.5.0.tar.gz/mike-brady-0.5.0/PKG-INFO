Description: 
        # Repo Blueprinter
        
        ## Overview
        The goal of this project is to provide an easy way to create a "repo blueprint template" from which developers can build their own projects. You can create placeholders in the template and populate the values when the new repo is created.
        
        ## Features
        * Uses the [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) template engine for easy and powerful templates
        * Limit templated files to specific file types
        * Template filenames and folders
        
        ## Why not just fork?
        Forking is great if you want to potentially merge back with the main project. In this case, we want to provide developers with a basic blueprint, let them fill in their own values, but they won't be merging back into the main project.
