`textle` is software to automate the use of typesetting and their support tools, like `LaTeX` and `pandoc`.

## Usage

[![usage example](https://asciinema.org/a/opmSpftGOmDFBJGWHhYvXu2BT.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/opmSpftGOmDFBJGWHhYvXu2BT)

For more information, see the full documentation on [read the docs](https://textle.readthedocs.io), or in the `docs/` folder.

## Installation

```
$ # textle is python3 only
$ pip3 install textle
```

Alternatively, install from source by cloning this repo and using

```
$ python3 setup.py install
```

To build the documentation to the `site` folder, 

```
$ mkdocs build
```

## Why

This tool was created as I often create small one-off TeX (sometimes from markdown through pandoc) projects that need to be formatted in similar ways, and that I like building quickly.
`textle` aims to solve these problems: it makes it easy to not only build a project to a PDF once, but even to do it live; and it makes simple the definition of the project. All one has to 
do is either use the CLI, which was designed to be powerful and simple, or write a `Textlefile`. The project also aimed to be lightweight, both binary-wise and filesystem-wise, the idea being to 
not pollute a VCS with random files.

The Usage section demonstrates my common use cases.
