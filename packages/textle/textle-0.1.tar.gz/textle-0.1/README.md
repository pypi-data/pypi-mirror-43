## Why

This tool was created as I often create small one-off TeX (sometimes from markdown through pandoc) projects that need to be formatted in similar ways, and that I like building quickly.
`textle` aims to solve these problems: it makes it easy to not only build a project to a PDF once, but even to do it live; and it makes simple the definition of the project. All one has to 
do is either use the CLI, which was designed to be powerful and simple, or write a `Textlefile`. The project also aimed to be lightweight, both binary-wise and filesystem-wise, the idea being to 
not pollute a VCS with random files.

The Usage section demonstrates my common use cases.
