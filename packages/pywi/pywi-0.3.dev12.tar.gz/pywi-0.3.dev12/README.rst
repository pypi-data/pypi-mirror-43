Description
===========

PyWI is a Python image filtering library aimed at removing additive background noise
from raster graphics images.

* Input: an image file containing the raster graphics to clean (i.e. an image
  defined as a classic rectangular lattice of square pixels).
* Output: an image file containing the cleaned raster graphics.

The image filter relies on multiresolution analysis methods (Wavelet
transforms) that remove some scales (frequencies) locally in space. These
methods are particularly efficient when signal and noise are located at
different scales (or frequencies). Optional features improve the SNR ratio when
the (clean) signal constitute a single cluster of pixels on the image (e.g.
electromagnetic showers produced with Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
Telescopes). This library is written in Python and is based on the existing
Cosmostat tools iSAp (Interactive Sparse Astronomical data analysis Packages
http://www.cosmostat.org/software/isap/).

The PyWI library also contains a dedicated package to optimize the image filter
parameters for a given set of images (i.e. to adapt the filter to a specific
problem). From a given training set of images (containing pairs of noised and
clean images) and a given performance estimator (a function that assess the
image filter parameters comparing the cleaned image to the actual clean image),
the optimizer can determine the optimal filtering level for each scale.

.. warning::

    This project is in beta stage.

Features
========

The PyWI library contains:

* wavelet transform and wavelet filtering functions for image multiresolution
  analysis and filtering;
* additional filter to remove some image components (non-significant pixels
  clusters);
* a set of generic filtering performance estimators (MSE, NRMSE, SSIM, PSNR,
  image moment's difference), some relying on the scikit-image Python library
  (supplementary estimators can be easily added to meet particular needs);
* a graphical user interface to visualize the filtering process in the wavelet
  transformed space;
* an Evolution Strategies (ES) algorithm known in the mathematical optimization
  community for its good convergence rate on generic derivative-free continuous
  global optimization problems (Beyer, H. G. (2013) "The theory of evolution
  strategies", Springer Science & Business Media);
* additional tools to manage and monitor the parameter optimization.

Dependencies
============

.. Highly inspired by http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/_sources/install.rst.txt

PyWI has the following strict requirements:

* `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ 3.5 or 3.6
* `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_

PyWI also depends on other packages for optional features:

* `Scipy <https://www.scipy.org/>`_
* `Scikit-image <http://scikit-image.org/>`_
* `Pillow (a.k.a. PIL) <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to read and write many image formats (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, ...)
* `Astropy <http://www.astropy.org/>`_ to provide Fits file format
* `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_ 1.5 or later to provide plotting functionality
* `Cosmostat iSAP Sparce2D <http://www.cosmostat.org/software/isap/>`_

However, note that these only need to be installed if those particular features
are needed. PyWI will import even if these dependencies are not installed.

.. _install:

Installation
============

Using pip
---------

Most major projects upload official packages to the *Python Package Index*.
They can be installed on most operating systems using Python standard `pip`
package manager.

Note that you need to have `Python3.x` and `pip` already installed on your system.

.. warning::

    Users of the Anaconda python distribution should follow the instructions
    for Anaconda install (see `Using conda`_ bellow).

.. note::

    You will need a C compiler (e.g. ``gcc`` or ``clang``) to be installed to
    install some dependencies (e.g. Numpy).

.. note::

    The ``--no-deps`` flag is optional, but highly recommended if you already
    have Numpy installed, since otherwise pip will sometimes try to "help" you
    by upgrading your Numpy installation, which may not always be desired.

.. note::

    If you get a ``PermissionError`` this means that you do not have the
    required administrative access to install new packages to your Python
    installation.  In this case you may consider using the ``--user`` option
    to install the package into your home directory. You can read more
    about how to do this in the `pip documentation
    <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs>`_.

    Alternatively, if you intend to do development on other software that uses
    PyWI, such as an affiliated package, consider installing PyWI into a
    `virtualenv <http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/development/workflow/virtualenv_detail.html#using-virtualenv>`_.

    Do **not** install PyWI or other third-party packages using ``sudo``
    unless you are fully aware of the risks.

On MacOSX and Gnu/Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can install PyWI using the following command (in a terminal)::

    pip install pywi --no-deps

.. python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib pandas

.. It is recommended to use the --user flag to ``pip`` (note: do not use sudo pip,
.. which can cause problems) to install packages in your local user space instead
.. of the shared system directories.
.. TODO: the --user flag has an issue (bug?): console scripts (pywi-mrfilter, ...)
.. are not directly (i.e. without updating the PATH variable) available anymore (at
.. least on MacOSX/Anaconda).

As an alternative, you can install PyWI from the downloaded source code::

    python3 setup.py install --no-deps

.. There's also a package for Debian/Ubuntu::
.. 
..     sudo apt-get install pywi

If PyWI is already installed on your system you can upgrade it with this command::

    pip install --upgrade pywi

To uninstall PyWI, type::

    pip uninstall pywi

On Windows
~~~~~~~~~~

.. Note:
.. 
..     The following installation procedure has been tested to work with Python
..     3.4 under Windows 7.
..     It should also work with recent Windows systems.

You can install PyWI using the following command (in a `command prompt`_)::

    py -m pip install pywi --no-deps

.. It is recommended to use the --user flag to ``pip`` (note: do not use sudo pip,
.. which can cause problems) to install packages in your local user space instead
.. of the shared system directories.
.. TODO: the --user flag has an issue (bug?): console scripts (pywi-mrfilter, ...)
.. are not directly (i.e. without updating the PATH variable) available anymore (at
.. least on MacOSX/Anaconda).

As an alternative, you can install PyWI from the downloaded source code::

    py setup.py install --no-deps

If PyWI is already installed on your system you can upgrade it with this command::

    py -m pip install --upgrade pywi

To uninstall PyWI, type::

    py -m uninstall pywi


.. _anaconda_install:

Using conda
-----------

To install this package with conda run in a terminal::

    conda install -c jdhp pywi

So far, the PyWI Anaconda package is only available for MacOSX.
A package for Linux and Windows will be available soon.

.. note::

    Attempting to use `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`__ to upgrade your installation of PyWI may result
    in a corrupted installation.

Cosmostat iSAP Sparce2D installation
====================================

1. Download http://www.cosmostat.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/ISAP_V3.1.tgz (see http://www.cosmostat.org/software/isap/)
2. Unzip this archive, go to the "sparse2d" directory and compile the sparse2d
   library. It should generate two executables named ``mr_transform`` and ``mr_filter``::

    tar -xzvf ISAP_V3.1.tgz
    cd ISAP_V3.1/cxx
    tar -xzvf sparse2d_V1.1.tgz
    cd sparse2d
    compile the content of this directory

An automated compilation and installation script for Linux is available
`there <https://github.com/tino-michael/tino_cta/blob/master/grid/compile_mrfilter_pilot.sh>`_
(author: `Tino Michael <https://github.com/tino-michael>`_).

.. Also available in `utils/compile_isap_sparce2d.sh`

Example
=======

1. Download a sample image (e.g. `archives_ngc3576.png <https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jeremiedecock/144c83f74e46b171ab3a426230d40848/raw/4a9ea99dd18504baff404a074a4e7541d98a50c5/archives_ngc3576.png>`_)
2. In your system terminal, from the directory that contains the sample image, type::
  
    pywi-mrtransform -t 256,256,256,0 --plot archives_ngc3576.png
    pywi-mrfilter -s 256,256,256,0 --plot archives_ngc3576.png

3. Type ``pywi-mrtransform -h`` or ``pywi-mrfilter -h`` to display the list of
   available options and their documentation.

.. A "benchmark mode" can also be used to clean images and assess cleaning
.. algorithms (it's still a bit experimental): use the additional option ``-b all``
.. in each command (and put several fits files in input e.g. ``\*.fits``)
