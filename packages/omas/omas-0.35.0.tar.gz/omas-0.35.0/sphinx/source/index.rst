  :alt: OMAS simplifies the interface between third-party codes with ITER IMAS

OMAS is a Python library designed to simplify the interface of third-party codes with the `ITER <http://iter.org>`_ Integrated Modeling and Analysis Suite (`IMAS <https://confluence.iter.org/display/IMP>`_).

* It provides a **convenient Python API**

* capable of storing data with **different file/database formats**

* in a form that is **always compatible with the IMAS data model**

Mapping the physics codes I/O to the IMAS data model is done in third party Python codes such as the `OMFIT framework <http://gafusion.github.io/OMFIT-source>`_.
