        cliquery |PyPI Version| |Build Status| |PyPI Monthly downloads|
        ===============================================================
        
        a command-line browser interface
        --------------------------------
        
        cliquery cuts down on clicking through command-line web searching, page
        previewing, and page bookmarking, among other features. An interactive
        prompt allows users to easily make successive queries and enter program
        flags dynamically; simply typing help will list all possible flags to
        enter. Opening a link will invoke a browser supplied by the user or
        detected automatically across Windows, OSX, and Linux platforms.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ::
        
            pip install cliquery --user
        
        or
        
        ::
        
            pip install git+https://github.com/huntrar/cliquery.git#egg=cliquery --user
        
        or
        
        ::
        
            git clone https://github.com/huntrar/cliquery
            cd cliquery
            python setup.py install --user
        
        If you encounter issues installing lxml, see
        `here <http://lxml.de/installation.html>`__.
        
        It is advised to copy the blank .cliqrc into .local.cliqrc, as .cliqrc
        will be emptied after a program update. To do this, enter the following:
        
        ::
        
            cd "$(dirname "$(cliquery -c)")" && cp .cliqrc .local.cliqrc
        
        
        
        Recommended (optional) setup
        ----------------------------
        
        Configuration setup is completely optional but will improve your experience.
        This includes integrating Google Custom Search, WolframAlpha, and/or selection of browser choice.
        
        
        The browser invoked is selected implicitly by the webbrowser module.
        To explicitly choose your browser, set the name in .local.cliqrc
        under 'browser' or set the BROWSER environment variable on your system.
        
        For best results, sign up for a `Google Custom Search API key <https://code.google.com/apis/console>`__
        This defaults search to Google, otherwise results will come from Bing.
        
        The instructions are as follows:
        Upon signing into Google, click on API Manager, then Credentials, and
        create an API key. Enter this under the 'google\_api\_key' field in
        .cliqrc.
        
        Next, `create a custom search engine <https://cse.google.com/all>`__.
        You must choose at least one site to search during creation (I chose
        stackoverflow.com), but to search the entire web you must click on this
        new search engine, go to Setup, then Basics, and select 'Search the
        entire web but emphasize included sites.' Then you may choose to keep or
        delete the site you originally provided.
        
        After creating a custom search engine, click on the engine, go to Setup,
        and under Details click Search engine ID. Enter this under the
        'google\_engine\_key' field.
        
        For WolframAlpha usage, sign up for a `WolframAlpha API key <https://developer.wolframalpha.com/portal/apisignup.html>`__
        Enter your key under the 'wolfram\_api\_key' field.
        
        Users may also import Firefox or Chrome bookmarks into .cliqrc by
        exporting the bookmarks to HTML and importing to cliquery with the -i
        flag. The imported bookmarks will be added to your existing bookmarks,
        which may result in duplicates.
        
        Usage
        -----

            positional arguments:
              QUERY                 keywords to search
        
            optional arguments:

        Notes
        -----
        
        -  Supports both Python 2.x and Python 3.x.
        -  NOTE: If you receive the following message (or similar) when trying
           to modify bookmarks:
        
           ::
        
               IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cliquery/.cliqrc'
        
           This means you did not follow the install advice and chose to install as root. You have three options:
        
           ::
        
               1. (recommended) Uninstall and reinstall as a non-root user by following the instructions above.
               2. Change the configuration file ownership from root to user by entering the following:
        
                       sudo chown $USER "$(cliquery -c)" 
        
               2. (not recommended) Execute cliquery as root, using su or sudo.
        
        -  A search may return immediate results, such as calculations or facts
           made possible by WolframAlpha, or instead a page of Google search
           results comprised of links and their descriptions.
        -  Interactive usage allows the user to continue making new queries by
           dynamically executing new program flags and/or queries. Entering h or
           help will list all possible prompt commands.

        -  To choose multiple links at once, a range may be specified by
           separating the start and end range with a dash. Leaving one end of
           the range blank will choose all links until the other end of that
           range. For example, given 10 links, entering 5- would effectively be
           the same as entering 5-10.
        -  Requests cache is enabled by default to cache webpages, it can be
           disabled by setting the environment variable CLIQ\_DISABLE\_CACHE.
        -  Using the bookmark flag with no arguments will list all current
           bookmarks in .cliqrc, naturally ordered by time of entry. Entering
           help with the flag will list all possible commands including open,
           add, remove, tag/untag (for aliasing), describe, and move. Bookmarks
           like other flags may be entered during runtime in the link prompt.
        -  Additional arguments may be appended to bookmarks while opening them.
           These are interpreted as any non-integer arguments which are not
           found in any bookmarks (URLs or tags).
