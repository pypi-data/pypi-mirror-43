    'long_description': "NegMAS\n******\n\n\n.. .. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/negmas/svg\n..         :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/negmas\n\n.. .. image:: https://img.shields.io/travis/yasserfarouk/negmas/svg\n..         :target: https://travis-ci.org/yasserfarouk/negmas\n\n.. .. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/negmas/badge/?version=latest\n..         :target: https://negmas/readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest\n..         :alt: Documentation Status\n\n\n\nA python library for managing autonomous negotiation agents in simulation environments. The name ``negmas`` stands for\neither NEGotiation MultiAgent System or NEGotiations Managed by Agent Simulations (your pick).\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThis package was designed to help advance the state-of-art in negotiation research by providing an easy-to-use yet\npowerful platform for autonomous negotiation targeting situated simultaneous negotiations.\nIt grew out of the NEC-AIST collaborative laboratory project.\n\nBy *situated* negotiations, we mean those for which utility functions are not pre-ordained by fiat but are a natural\nresult of a simulated business-like process.\n\nBy *simultaneous* negotiations, we mean sessions of dependent negotiations for which the utility value of an agreement\nof one session is affected by what happens in other sessions.\n\nThe documentation is available at: documentation_\n\n.. _documentation: http://www.yasserm.com/negmas/index.html\n\nMain Features\n=============\n\nThis platform was designed with both flexibility and scalability in mind. The key features of the NegMAS package are:\n\n#. The public API is decoupled from internal details allowing for scalable implementations of the same interaction\n   protocols.\n#. Supports agents engaging in multiple concurrent negotiations.\n#. Provides support for inter-negotiation synchronization either through coupled utility functions or through central\n   *control* agents.\n#. The package provides sample negotiators that can be used as templates for more complex negotiators.\n#. The package supports both mediated and unmediated negotiations.\n#. Supports both bilateral and multilateral negotiations.\n#. Novel negotiation protocols and simulated *worlds* can be added to the package as easily as adding novel negotiators.\n#. Allows for non-traditional negotiation scenarios including dynamic entry/exit from the negotiation.\n#. A large variety of built in utility functions.\n#. Utility functions can be active dynamic entities which allows the system to model a much wider range of dynamic ufuns\n   compared with existing packages.\n#. A distributed system with the same interface and industrial-strength implementation is being created allowing agents\n   developed for NegMAS to be seemingly employed in real-world business operations.\n\nTo use negmas in a project\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import negmas\n\nThe package was designed for many uses cases. On one extreme, it can be used by an end user who is interested in running\none of the built-in negotiation protocols. On the other extreme, it can be used to develop novel kinds of negotiation\nagents, negotiation protocols, multi-agent simulations (usually involving situated negotiations), etc.\n\nRunning existing negotiators/negotiation protocols\n==================================================\n\nUsing the package for negotiation can be as simple as the following code snippet:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from negmas import SAOMechanism, AspirationNegotiator, MappingUtilityFunction\n    session = SAOMechanism(outcomes=10, n_steps=100)\n    negotiators = [AspirationNegotiator(name=f'a{_}') for _ in range(5)]\n    for negotiator in negotiators:\n        session.add(negotiator, ufun=MappingUtilityFunction(lambda x: random.random() * x[0]))\n\n    session.run()\n\nIn this snippet, we created a mechanism session with an outcome-space of *10* discrete outcomes that would run for *10*\nsteps. Five agents with random utility functions are then created and *added* to the session. Finally the session is\n*run* to completion. The agreement (if any) can then be accessed through the *state* member of the session. The library\nprovides several analytic and visualization tools to inspect negotiations. See the first tutorial on\n*Running a Negotiation* for more details.\n\nDeveloping a negotiator\n=======================\n\nDeveloping a novel negotiator slightly more difficult by is still doable in few lines of code:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from negmas.negotiators import Negotiator\n    class MyAwsomeNegotiator(Negotiator):\n        def __init__(self):\n            # initialize the parents\n            Negotiator.__init__(self)\n            MultiNegotiationsMixin.__init__(self)\n\n        def respond_(self, offer, state):\n            # decide what to do when receiving an offer @ that negotiation\n            pass\n\n        def propose_(self, state):\n            # proposed the required number of proposals (or less) @ that negotiation\n            pass\n\nBy just implementing `respond_()` and `propose_()`. This negotiator is now capable of engaging in alternating offers\nnegotiations. See the documentation of `Negotiator` for a full description of available functionality out of the box.\n\nDeveloping a negotiation protocol\n=================================\n\nDeveloping a novel negotiation protocol is actually even simpler:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from negmas.mechanisms import Mechanism\n\n    class MyNovelProtocol(Mechanism):\n        def __init__(self):\n            super().__init__()\n\n        def step_(self):\n            # one step of the protocol\n            pass\n\nBy implementing the single `step_()` function, a new protocol is created. New negotiators can be added to the\nnegotiation using `add()` and removed using `remove()`. See the documentation for a full description of\n`Mechanism` available functionality out of the box [Alternatively you can use `Protocol` instead of `Mechanism`].\n\n\nRunning a world simulation\n==========================\n\nThe *raison d'Ãªtre* for NegMAS is to allow you to develop negotiation agents capable of behaving in realistic\n*business like* simulated environments. These simulations are called *worlds* in NegMAS. Agents interact with each other\nwithin these simulated environments trying their maximize some intrinsic utility function of the agent through several\n*possibly simultaneous* negotiations.\n\nThe `situated` module provides all that you need to create such worlds. An example can be found in the `scml` package.\nThis package implements a supply chain management system in which factory managers compete to maximize their profits in\na market with only negotiations as the means of securing contracts.\n\n\nAcknowledgement\n===============\n\n.. _Genius: http://ii.tudelft.nl/genius\n\nNegMAS tests use scenarios used in ANAC 2010 to ANAC 2018 competitions obtained from the Genius_ Platform. These domains\ncan be found in the tests/data and notebooks/data folders.\n",
