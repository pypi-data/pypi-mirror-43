Description: # plottingtools
        A collection of tools that I use for plotting often enough (or with enough
        complexity) to necessitate creating a useful API.
        
        
        ## Overview
        ---
        This package is intended to make plotting as easy as possible for simple data
        science visualizations. It's essentially a wrapper around matplotlib and is
        designed to simplify the process of creating quick plots. While it's certainly
        not as powerful as using matplotlib directly, it hopefully makes it a lot
        easier to display information quickly.
        
        This package does not rely on (or currently support) pandas `DataFrames`, and
        expects data to be in vector form (ideally a numpy `ndarray`). 
        
        
        ## Functionality
        ---
        Currently, this package does the following:
        - Display data as bars on a single plot
            - Single/multi color
            - Scaled by a scalar or broadcastable array-like object
            - Shown as percentages
            - Text:
                - Titles
                - legends
                - X-axis labels
                - over-bar labels
            - Examples:
                located in plottingtools/examples/bars
        - Display line plots
            - Single or multiple lines
            - Formatting options for each line
            - Labeling
            - Titles
            - Simple formatting of the figure
        
        
        ## Installation
        ` pip install plottingtools `
