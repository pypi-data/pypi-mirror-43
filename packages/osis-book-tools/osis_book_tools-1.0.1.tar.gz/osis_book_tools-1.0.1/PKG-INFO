Description: # OSIS Book Tools
        
        This packages contains tools for converting between OSIS abbreviations
        (both IDs and paratext abbreviations) for books in the canonical Old and
        New Testaments and localized book names.
        
        The core of this is a sqlite database which does all the mappings, and ensures basic
        data integrity. Data is currently loaded once during module init. After that, all
        operations are in-memory.
        
        This abbreviations were compiled from https://wiki.crosswire.org/OSIS_Book_Abbreviations
        (fetched 2019-03-25).
        
        ## Usage Examples
        
        ### Reference a book via enumeration value
        
        ```python
        OSISBook.Gen    # Genesis
        OSISBook._1Sam  # 1 Samuel (note the leading underscore to make the identifier valid)
        ```
        
        ### Construct a book from a paratext value
        
        ```python
        OSISBook.from_paratext("GEN")
        ```
        
        ### Get the paratext abbreviation for a book
        
        ```python
        OSISBook.Gen.paratext_abbreviation
        ```
        
        ### Get the localized name of a book
        
        This function expects the shortest possible ISO 639 code available for the language. English
        is guaranteed to be available, so use this as a fallback.
        
        ```python
        OSISBook.Gen.localized_name("en")
        ```
        
        ### Get the localized chapter descriptor for a book
        
        This function returns the chapter descriptor, which may be slightly different from the name. Use this when
        constructing a reference string. For example, you write `Psalm 23`, not `Psalms 23`. This is the difference
        between `localized_name` and `chapter_descriptor`.
        
        Like `localized_name`, this function expects the shortest possible ISO 639 code available for the language. English
        is guaranteed to be available, so use this as a fallback. If a localized name exists, a chapter descriptor must
        also exist.
        
        ```python
        OSISBook.Gen.chapter_descriptor("en")
        ```
