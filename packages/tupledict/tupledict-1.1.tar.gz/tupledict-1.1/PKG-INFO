Description: `tupledict`: a multi-key dictionary
        ===================================
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        The ``tupledict.TupleDict`` class provides all the functionality of a regular dictionary.
        
        In addition you can use tuple-based keys:
        
        ``` python
        d = TupleDict()
        
        d[1,2,3] = 123
        d[1,2,4] = 124
        d[2,3,4] = 234
        d[3,3,4] = 334
        ```
        All keys should have the same length otherwise a `KeyError` will be raised.  When setting values, keys should not contain `None` values.
        
        To retrieve values you can use `None` as a wildcard character.
        ``` python
        d[1,2,3]  -> 123
        d[1,None,None] -> [123, 124]
        d[1,None,3] -> [123]
        ```
        When a wildcard is used the dictionary returns a list of values.  When no wildcard is used the result is a single item.
