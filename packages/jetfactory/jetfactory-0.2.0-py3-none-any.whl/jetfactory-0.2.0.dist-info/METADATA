Jetfactory is a Python framework for creating structured, portable and high-performance 
Web APIs. It's built on top of [Sanic](https://github.com/huge-success/sanic) and uses the 
blazing fast [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop)
implementation of the asyncio event loop.

Features and limitations:
- Lightweight, delivers high performance and high concurrency
- Scales horizontally
- Comes with a REST API browser
- Asynchronous; code must be non-blocking
- Built-in support for Mysql and Postgres databases
- Provides intuitive tools for object serialization
- Works only with modern versions of Python (3.6+)
- Created with Docker/Kubernetes in mind


Getting started
---

You can read more about Jetfactory in the [Documentation](https://jetfactory.readthedocs.io),
or check out an [Example](https://github.com/rbw/jet-guestbook).


Development
---
While Jetfactory does work, it's currently under heavy development; Expect some breakage, as well as lacking documentation and tests.
That being said - I would very much appreciate people testing out the software, and perhaps even contribute with code.
