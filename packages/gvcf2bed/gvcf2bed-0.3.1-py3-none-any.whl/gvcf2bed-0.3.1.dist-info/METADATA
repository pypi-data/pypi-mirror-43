GVCF2BED
========

This is a small tool to convert a gVCF file to BED. This is useful for
extracting regions that pass a certain genotype quality threshold.

Installation
------------

gvcf2bed is now available through pypi with: ``pip install gvcf2bed``

Requirements
------------

-  Python 3.4+
-  pyvcf
-  cyvcf2

For developers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  pytest
-  pytest-cov

Changelog
---------

0.3.1
~~~~~

-  Fix a bug for variants where GQ is not defined.

0.3
~~~

-  Use ``cyvcf2`` by default in tool. This results in a speed-up of
   approximately 8-10x. Existing API has not changed, and will still
   work with ``pyvcf``.
-  Add separate filter for non-variants, as GQ scores may have a
   different distribution on non-variant records than on variant
   records.

Usage
-----

::

    usage: gvcf2bed [-h] -I INPUT -O OUTPUT [-s SAMPLE] [-q QUALITY]
                    [-nq NON_VARIANT_QUALITY] [-b]

    Create a BED file from a gVCF. Regions are based on a minimum genotype
    quality. The gVCF file must contain a GQ field in its FORMAT fields. GQ scores
    of non-variants records have a different distribution from the GQ score
    distribution of variant records. Hence, an option is provided to set a
    different threshold for non-variant positions.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -I INPUT, --input INPUT
                            Input gVCF
      -O OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                            Output bed file
      -s SAMPLE, --sample SAMPLE
                            Sample name in VCF file to use. Will default to first
                            sample (alphabetically) if not supplied
      -q QUALITY, --quality QUALITY
                            Minimum genotype quality (default 20)
      -nq NON_VARIANT_QUALITY, --non-variant-quality NON_VARIANT_QUALITY
                            Minimum genotype quality for non-variant records
                            (default 20)
      -b, --bedgraph        Output in bedgraph mode
