Basic Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    from abc_analysis import abc_analysis, abc_plot

    # Perform an ABC analysis on a numeric vector (without plotting)
    dctAnalysis = abc_analysis([1, 15, 25, 17, 2, 3, 5, 6, 2, 3, 22])

    # Perform an ABC analysis with plotting
    dctAnalysis = abc_analysis([1, 15, 25, 17, 2, 3, 5, 6, 2, 3, 22], True)

    # Plot saved results of an ABC analysis
    abc_plot(dctAnalysis)
