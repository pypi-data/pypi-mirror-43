*Prost!* (PRocessing Of Small Transcripts) is a python application that
quantifies and annotates microRNA (miRNA) expression in metazoans with
assembled genomes.  *Prost!* works by counting short transcripts within a
user-specifiable length range.  These counted transcripts are aligned to a user
specifiable genome allowing for post-transcriptional modification (e.g.
untemplated additions, editing, alternative cutting) and then "binned" together
based on genomic location.  Each bin is then annotated with databases of mature
miRNAs, hairpins, and other types of RNAs (the databases may be derived from
miRBase, Ensembl's BioMart, other databases, or may be custom built by the
user).
