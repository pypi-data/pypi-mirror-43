Description: # Deep Alignment Network PyTorch
        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/justusschock/deep_alignment_network_pytorch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/justusschock/deep_alignment_network_pytorch) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/justusschock/deep_alignment_network_pytorch/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/justusschock/deep_alignment_network_pytorch)
        
        This repository contains a [`delira`](https://github.com/justusschock/delira)-compatible implementation of the Deep Alignment Network.
        
        The original implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/MarekKowalski/DeepAlignmentNetwork) and the paper is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01789)
        
        An example using the HELEN dataset can be found in the [notebooks](notebooks/felen_example.ipynb) folder.
        
        ## Installation
        
        This repository can be installed from pip via:
        ```
        pip install deep-alignment-pytorch
        ```
        
        or from source via
        ```
        pip install git+https://github.com/justusschock/deep_alignment_network_pytorch
        ```
        
        An installation from pip will be possible soon, once the complete repository setup is completed.
