        Threadverify - verifying clean thread management
        ================================================
        
        The Robot Framework test library *crl.threadverify* is for verifying that the
        threads are used in the correct ways. For example it checks that no threads
        are not left hanging after the test case execution. The library will help in
        debugging the problems by showing the thread creation stack and traces from the
        creation time of the new threads.
