Description: python-semantic-release
        =======================
        
        This is a fork of python-semantic-release.
        I created this fork because invoke has been blacklisted by my corporate overlords (actually their firewall).
        So in order to be able to use this package anyway I removed the dependency and published it under another name.
        Cheers,
        s
