#Extensions to use the SR700 freshroast with a Phidget sensor (hub or not) or max31865 


# max31865 additions

- if RPi.GPIO isn't available, because not running on Raspberry PI, the import of max31865 will fail.  However that isn't a hard failure.  It just raises an exception later if caller does try to use the max31865.  This allows this module to gracefully disable the max31865 part of itself on non-Raspberry PI devices.

- Regarding GPIO pins, the module uses BCM addressing (see https://pinout.xyz/), so csPin = 8, for example, corresponds to BCM 8 in the pinout diagram.
