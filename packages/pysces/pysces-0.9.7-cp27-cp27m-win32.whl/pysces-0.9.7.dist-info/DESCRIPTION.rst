PySCeS is developed by the Triple-J Group for Molecular Cell Physiology
in order to try model and understand the complex processes and systems
which make up the living cell.

   PySCeS features, amongst other things:
   - A text based model description language.
   - A structural analysis module.
   - Integrators for time simulation
   - Non-linear solvers for steady-state analysis
   - A module for performing Metabolic Control Analysis
   - A bifurcation module for systems which exhibit multiple steady states
   - A variety of extra utilites for parameter scans, data output and plotting.
   - A dynamic module loading framework.
   - SBML import and export capability.
