        This is the sample Python client for *ricloud*, Reincubate’s `Cloud Data
        API <https://www.reincubate.com/ricloud-cloud-data-api/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ricloud-py&utm_campaign=ricloud>`__.
        
            Refer to the comprehensive *ricloud*
            `documentation <https://docs.reincubate.com/ricloud/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ricloud-py&utm_campaign=ricloud>`__
            for a fuller picture of the API’s capabilities, specifications, and
            benefits. See also the `Apple iCloud
            service <https://docs.reincubate.com/ricloud/icloud-backups/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ricloud-py&utm_campaign=ricloud>`__
            documentation for its rich capabilities in accessing iCloud data.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        The library can be installed with a single command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ pip install ricloud
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        A sample script is included which provides an example of how the API can
        be used to access a range of datatypes in a way that is compatible with
        Apple’s 2FA mechanism.
        
        To run the sample script in interactive mode, execute the following
        command:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
            $ python -m ricloud john.appleseed@reincubate.com --password=joshua
