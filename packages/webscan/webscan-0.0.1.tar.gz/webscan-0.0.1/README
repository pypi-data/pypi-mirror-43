Installation
============

To create virtual environment and install all dependencies run::

    make build

You can change dependencies in project/requirements.txt
By default `make build` command creates virtual environment for python3.
If you need python2, change Makefile.


Usage
=====

To launch scraping process run::

    run crawl <spider_name>

where <spider_name> is undescored name of your spider class.

Underscore name means that if spider class has name FooBarSpider then the
command will be `run crawl foo_bar_spider`.

To let `run crawl` command know where your spider class is located you
should put the corresponding module in 
GRAB_SPIDER_CONFIG::global::spider_modules variable in project/settings.py

By default the project is configured to use MongoDB, to change mongodb
connection settings and database name change MONGODB_CONNECTION and 
MONGODB_NAME in the project/settings.py
