    some options it can also be used to add content with only part of the

    not exist in the working tree anymore.

    this snapshot that is taken as contents of the next commit. Thus after

    Reapply commits on top of abother base tip.

    If <branch> is specified, git rebase will perform an automatic ``git
    checkout <branch>`` before doing anything else. Otherwise it remains on
    the current branch.

    If <upstream> is not specified, the upstream configured in
    branch.<name>.remote and branch.<name>.merge options will be used (see
    :doc:`cmd-config` for details) and the ``--fork-point`` option is assumed.
    If you are currently not on any branch or if the current branch does not
    have a configured upstream, the rebase will abort.

    All changes made by commits in the current branch but that are not in
    <upstream> are saved to a temporary area. This is the same set of commits
    that would be shown by ``git log <upstream>..HEAD``; or by ``git log
    'fork_point'..HEAD``, if ``--fork-point`` is active (see the description
    on ``--fork-point`` below); or by git log HEAD, if the ``--root`` option
    is specified.

    The current branch is reset to <upstream>, or <newbase> if the --onto
    option was supplied. This has the exact same effect as git reset --hard
    <upstream> (or <newbase>). ORIG_HEAD is set to point at the tip of the
    branch before the reset.

    The commits that were previously saved into the temporary area are then
    reapplied to the current branch, one by one, in order. Note that any
    commits in HEAD which introduce the same textual changes as a commit in
    HEAD..<upstream> are omitted (i.e., a patch already accepted upstream with
    a different commit message or timestamp will be skipped).

    It is possible that a merge failure will prevent this process from being
    completely automatic. you will have to resolve any such merge failure and
    run ``git rebase --continue``. Another option is to bypass the commit that
    caused the merge failure with ``git rebase --skip``. To check out the
    original <branch> and remove the .git/rebase-apply working files, use the
    command ``git rebase --abort`` instead.
