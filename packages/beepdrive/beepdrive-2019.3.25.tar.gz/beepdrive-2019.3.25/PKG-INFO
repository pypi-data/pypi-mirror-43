        ## Dependencies
        
        [Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/intl/it_ALL/chrome/) v71-73 (or Chromium)

        ### MacOS, Windows
        MacOS and Windows users can download the latest GUI releases from https://github.com/amecava/beepdrive/releases.
        
        ### Alternatively, using pip3
        Using the `PyPi` repositories and the package manager `pip3` (`python3` required), open the terminal and type:
        
        ```python
        pip3 install beepdrive
        ```
        
        >  **Warning:** 
        For Linux users, beepdrive will be installed by default in the ``~/.local/bin`` directory. 
        The ``PATH`` will have to be set accordingly.
        One way of doing this is by adding the following line to the ``~/.bashrc`` file:
        >
        >  ``export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin`` 
        
        To update beepdrive from the `PyPi` repositories, open the terminal and type:
        ```
        pip3 install --upgrade beepdrive
        ```

        ```python
        beepdrive
        ```
        
        ### Console version
        
        You can directly specify the output folder path using the `--path` flag, this will launch a console version of beepdrive:

        beepdrive --path /output/folder/path/
        ```
