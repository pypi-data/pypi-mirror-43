# solardatatools

Tools for performing common tasks on solar PV data signals. These tasks include finding clear days in
a data set, common data transforms, and fixing time stamp issues. These tools are designed to be
automatic and require little if any input from the user. Librarys are included to help with data IO
and plotting as well.  

See notebooks folder for examples.

## Setup

From a fresh `python` environment, run the following from the base project folder:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To test that everything is working correctly, launch

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

and run the two notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.
