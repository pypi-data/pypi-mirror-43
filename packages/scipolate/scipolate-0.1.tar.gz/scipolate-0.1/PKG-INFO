Description: SciPolate
        =========
        
        Scipolate offers a small helper class that can be used to perform 
        2D interpolation tasks using scipy. It is meant to be used as a common 
        interface to run and validate the task automated in the same way.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Install Scipolate using pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install scipolate
        ```
        
        Note
        ====
        
        Scipolate was originally a part of a interpolation web-app used in one of my 
        lectures. That means it was used in an API. Hence, the parameters are set in 
        one single JSON-like dictionary, which is un-pythonic and I am planning to 
        create another interface class that takes arguments in a used, pythonic way.
        
        For the same reason, the class does provide an output *Report* including the 
        result as a base64 encoded image. Nevertheless, the class can be used outside 
        of a web-application context. Mind that performance was not important during 
        development. In case you need a fast algorithm, use scipy directly, or 
        something like the [interpolation](https://pypi.org/project/interpolation/) 
        library.
