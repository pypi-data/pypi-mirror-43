Description: # pyprinttree [![build status](https://travis-ci.org/rennat/pyprinttree.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rennat/pyprinttree)
        
        Use it to print a pretty text based tree representation of whatever data
        you feel like shoving into the graph structure.
        
        _I like `git log --oneline --graph --all` and find it handy to be able
        to generate similar graphs._
        
        
        ## Development

        I will merge failing tests if they highlight an issue.
