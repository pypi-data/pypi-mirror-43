ISR (Image Super-Resolution) is a library to upscale and improve the quality of low resolution images.

It includes the Keras implementations of:

- The super-scaling Residual Dense Network described in Residual Dense Network
  for Image Super-Resolution (Zhang et al. 2018)
- The super-scaling Residual in Residual Dense Network described
  in ESRGAN: Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (Wang et al. 2018)
- A multi-output version of the Keras VGG19 network for deep features extraction used in the perceptual loss
- A custom discriminator network based on the one described in
  Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network (SRGANS, Ledig et al. 2017)

ISR is compatible with Python 3.6 and is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.
