Description: 
        ISR (Image Super-Resolution) is a library to upscale and improve the quality of low resolution images.
        
        It includes the Keras implementations of:
        
        - The super-scaling Residual Dense Network described in Residual Dense Network
          for Image Super-Resolution (Zhang et al. 2018)
        - The super-scaling Residual in Residual Dense Network described
          in ESRGAN: Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (Wang et al. 2018)
        - A multi-output version of the Keras VGG19 network for deep features extraction used in the perceptual loss
        - A custom discriminator network based on the one described in
          Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network (SRGANS, Ledig et al. 2017)

        ISR is compatible with Python 3.6 and is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.
