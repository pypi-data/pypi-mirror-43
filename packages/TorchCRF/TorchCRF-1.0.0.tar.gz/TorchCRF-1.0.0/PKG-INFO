Description: # Torch CRF
        
        Implementation of CRF (Conditional Random Fields) in PyTorch 1.0
        
        ## Requirements
        
        - python3 (>=3.6)
        - PyTorch 1.0
        
        ## Installation
        
            $ pip install TorchCRF
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```python
        >>> import torch
        >>> from TorchCRF import CRF
        >>> batch_size = 2
        >>> sequence_size = 3
        >>> num_labels = 5
        >>> mask = torch.FloatTensor([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0]]) # (batch_size. sequence_size)
        >>> labels = torch.LongTensor([[0, 2, 3], [1, 4, 1]])  # (batch_size, sequence_size)
        >>> hidden = torch.randn((batch_size, sequence_size, num_labels), requires_grad=True)
        >>> crf = CRF(num_labels)
        ```
        
        ### Computing log-likelihood (used where forward)
        
        ```python
        >>> crf.forward(hidden, labels, mask)
        tensor([-7.6204, -3.6124], grad_fn=<ThSubBackward>)
        ```
        
        ### Decoding (predict labels of sequences)
        
        ```python
        >>> crf.viterbi_decode(hidden, mask)
        [[0, 2, 2], [4, 0]]
        ```
