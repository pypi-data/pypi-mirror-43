===================

![CSV lexer demonstration](https://imgur.com/g8TtkgW.png)

A simple, custom [CSV lexer](http://pygments.org/docs/lexerdevelopment/) for the [Pygments syntax highlighter](http://pygments.org/).

The code is originally based on [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25508711/298171). The project, in its current incarnation, is a fork of [this repo here](https://github.com/Kristinita/PygmentsCSVLexer).
