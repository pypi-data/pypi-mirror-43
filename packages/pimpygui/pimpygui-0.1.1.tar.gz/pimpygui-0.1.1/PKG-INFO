Description: pimpygui
        ========
        
        *pimpygui* is a tool that demonstrates some functions of the *pimpy* package. It installs the command line tool
        ``pimpy_gallery``, which is a GUI for applying image processing functions.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        Install from pip::
        
            python -m pip install pimpygui
        
        Usage:
        ------
        
        If binaries of installed python packages are added to the PATH, you can call ``pimpy_gallery`` directly from the shell::
        
            pimpy_gallery
        
        Otherwise, it can be invoked using python::
        
            python -m pimpygui.gallery
        
        Overview:
        ---------
        
        The ``pimpy_gallery`` GUI contains the following effects:
        
        * *Smooth:* Applies a gaussian filter which blurs the image.
        * *Main colors:* Reduces the image to a given number of colors. The colors can be set by the user or guessed
          algorithmically using k-means clustering.
        * *Edges:* Finds all edges of the given image. It adds an edge between two neighboring pixels if their color values are
          different. You should apply the *main colors* effect before creating the edge image, since an edge is inserted even if
          the colors are visually identical but slightly different.
        * *Paint by number:* Applies the *edge* effect and additionally inserts labels in the image segments. This can be used
          to create prototype images for the popular *paint by number* artworks. Usually, you first need to apply the *smooth*
          and *main colors* effects, since images are often too noisy for useful results.
