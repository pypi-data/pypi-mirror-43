Description: # tesla_client
        
        This library allows access to the unofficial Tesla API for reading data and issuing commands to Tesla vehicles.
        
        A key feature of this library is that it offers an easy way to sync OAuth credentials with a data store of your choice. Credentials are auto-saved on login, or during token refreshes.
        
        ## Quick Start
        
        ``` {.sourceCode .python}
        import tesla_client
        
        tesla_client.init(CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET)  # Get these values from https://pastebin.com/pS7Z6yyP
        
        # Define an Account subclass of your own to manage OAuth credential storage
        class MyTeslaAccount(tesla_client.Account):
            def get_credentials(self):
                return your_credentials_store.get()
        
            def save_credentials(self, creds):
                your_credentials_store.save(creds)
        
        
        account = MyTeslaAccount()
        
        # Log in (and automatically save the OAuth credentials)
        account.login('mrsteven@gmail.com', 'password')
        
        # Access a vehicle in this account
        vehicle = account.get_vehicles()[0]
        
        # Fetch some data from the vehicle
        vehicle.data_request('drive_state')
        
        # Send a command to the vehicle
        vehicle.command('honk_horn')
        ```
