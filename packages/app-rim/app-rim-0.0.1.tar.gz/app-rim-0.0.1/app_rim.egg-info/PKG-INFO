        Application Runtime Image Managerc - python module enabling to manage
        ( backup , restore, organize ) files that get created durring usage 
        of applications in users profile dir. This module primarly targets 
        linux environments, it may work in other setups. Support for thoose 
        might be added in future
        
        ## Background
        
        In linux each system user is associated with user profile dir. Next
        when a user uses an application like dropbox ( or others ) a subdir
        in profile is created named ".dropbox" and it stores the user 
        configuration of application as well as logs or other stuff app
        needs to work properly. 
        
        ## Goal
        
        This project aims to build a python module that will allow the 
        following:
        
        1) Create a tar archive of application configuration ( accounting for 
        diffrent location of this files ie. ".config", ".local/share" ). 
        2) allow restoration from backup stored in a globally defined backup 
        dir
        3) Provide the means to reconfigure existing application files into 
          directory hierarchy that is more compatible with xdg definition
          ( configuration files go into .config temporary, files go into  
            .cache, logs go into var/log, others go into .local/share )
        
        4) Provied means to detec what applications have been used by user
           based on what configuration files have been created ( carefully 
           crafting a list of known non aplication dirs ie. 
           .loca/share/application )
