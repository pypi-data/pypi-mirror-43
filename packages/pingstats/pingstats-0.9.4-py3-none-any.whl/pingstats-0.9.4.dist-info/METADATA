====================
Software Description
====================

This script provides a simple CLI based ping visualization script by utilizing `hipster plot`_ with customize-able UI views.

The software aims to remain lightweight and as os-independent as possible while maintaining ex sensibility throughout the software.

----------------------
Why should you use it?
----------------------

.. *Right, but why would I use it?*

The long and short is that ``pingstats`` provides a simple and stable method to visualize average ping over time from the command line. Aside from that, it provides the following features:

- Provides a highly modular dynamic UI layout selector, allowing the user to modify the way the software presents data.

- Provides a simple API for implementing unique and new UI behaviour

- Automatically resizes and stays aware of viewport size

- Stays under a megabyte of total size

============
Installation
============

Installation has been made easy on any system that implements ``pip3``.
::

  pip3 install pingstats

Examples of software in use

In this image, we can see two separate outputs. The top display is a display of the most recent actual return times, whereas the bottom display is the average return time for each sequence.

This display automatically scales to whatever window you have open, adding more lines and columns as necessary.
