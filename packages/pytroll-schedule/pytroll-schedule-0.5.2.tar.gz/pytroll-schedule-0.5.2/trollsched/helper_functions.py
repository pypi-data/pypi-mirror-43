    """This function computes a rough estimate of the coordinates for
    the point on the surface of the Earth where the Sun is directly
    overhead at the time dt. Precision is down to a few degrees. This
    means that the equinoxes (when the sign of the latitude changes)
    will be off by a few days.

    The function is intended only for visualization. For more precise
    calculations consider for example the PyEphem package.
