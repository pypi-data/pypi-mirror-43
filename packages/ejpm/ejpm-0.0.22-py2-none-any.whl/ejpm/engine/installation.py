# This module contains classes, which hold information about how to install packets


class PacketInstallationInstruction(object):

    This class stores information which is pretty similar for each package (like directory structure)

    MyPacketInstallationInstruction(PacketInstallationInstruction):

        # defining:

        def set_app_path(...)  # - function that setups variables when the installation path is known

        def step_install(...)  # - installs application
        def step_download(...) # - downloads from network
