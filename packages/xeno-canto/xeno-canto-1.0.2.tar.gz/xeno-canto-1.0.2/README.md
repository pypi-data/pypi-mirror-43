# xeno-canto API Wrapper

xeno-canto-py is an API wrapper designed to help users easily download xeno-canto.org recordings and associated information.

Originally created to aid in data collection and filtering for the training of machine learning models.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install xeno-canto-py, or copy and paste the ```xenocanto.py``` file into your working directory.

```bash
pip install xeno-canto
```

## Usage

```get_json``` and ```get_mp3``` can be used to retrieve the JSON file and recordings from a query. Queries must be made according to the conventions detailed on the xeno-canto.org API search tips page found [here](https://www.xeno-canto.org/help/search).

The following commands will retrieve the query information for the genus *Otis* through ```get_json``` and then the recordings through ```get_mp3```. Both functions will return a list of file paths to the newly saved files for further use if required.

```python
import xenocanto


json_list = xenocanto.get_json(['gen:Otis'])
mp3_list = xenocanto.get_mp3(json_list)
```

```get_rec``` calls ```get_json``` with the provided query and immediately  calls ```get_mp3``` afterwards.

The following command will produce the same result as above.

```python
import xenocanto

xenocanto.get_rec(['gen:Otis'])
```

This will generate two folders, ```queries``` and ```recordings``` which will contain the JSON files with query data and recordings as MP3 files respectively.

## Roadmap

* Add filtering of ```recordings``` folders (mainly by quality and background species)
* Add basic pre-processing abilities (file conversion, re-sampling, etc.) on a as-needed basis
* Add entrypoints for easier use

I am always open to suggestions for features!
