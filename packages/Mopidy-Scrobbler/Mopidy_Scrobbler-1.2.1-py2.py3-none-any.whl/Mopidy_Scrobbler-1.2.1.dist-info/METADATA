Changelog
=========

v1.2.1 (2019-03-10)
-------------------

- Require pylast < 3, as that version removed support for Python 2.7. (Fixes:
  #30)

v1.2.0 (2018-04-01)
-------------------

- Require pylast >= 1.6.0, which is the version packed in Debian stable.

- Fix compatability with pylast >= 2, which has removed the ``ScrobblingError``
  exception type.

v1.1.1 (2014-12-29)
-------------------

- Updated to work with ``None`` as the default value of ``track_no`` in
  Mopidy's ``Track`` model. This was changed in Mopidy 0.19.5. (Fixes: #7)

v1.1.0 (2014-01-20)
-------------------

- Updated extension API to match Mopidy 0.18.

v1.0.0 (2013-10-08)
