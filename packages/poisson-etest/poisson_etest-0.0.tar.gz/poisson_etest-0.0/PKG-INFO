Description: 
        A numpy binding for the Poisson E-Test, described in this paper:
        
        http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~kxk4695/JSPI-04.pdf
        
        I basically just minimally edited the original fortran code so that numpy f2py
        could pick it up. The original code can be found in an early commit to this repo
        or via this link:
