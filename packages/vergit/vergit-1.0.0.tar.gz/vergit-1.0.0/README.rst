vergit
======

A simple tool for extracting version information from git tags and formatting
it with optional post-release commit info.

The post-release commit info can tell you if there have been additional commits
beyond the revision tagged with the release version.  For example,
an output of ``1.0.0+git-1-123abcd`` would indicate that the version in use is
one commit after the 1.0.0 release, with the current commit having a SHA of
``123abcd``.

Installation
------------

Install from PyPI::

    pip install vergit


Usage
-----

Full usage::

    vergit [-h] [--format {long,short,default,json}] [path]

The ``path`` can be omitted and defaults to the current directory.

There are several different formats which can be used:

* ``long`` Always include the git revision info.
* ``short`` Never include the git revision info.
* ``default`` Hide the git revision info unless the current release is a
  pre-release or there are additional commits after the release.
* ``json`` Output JSON data describing the version, in the form:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "git": "+git-0-123abcd",
     "gitn": "0",
     "gitsha": "123abcd",
     "pre_release": true
   }
