Description: vergit
        ======
        
        A simple tool for extracting version information from git tags and formatting
        it with optional post-release commit info.
        
        The post-release commit info can tell you if there have been additional commits
        beyond the revision tagged with the release version.  For example,
        an output of ``1.0.0+git-1-123abcd`` would indicate that the version in use is
        one commit after the 1.0.0 release, with the current commit having a SHA of
        ``123abcd``.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install from PyPI::
        
            pip install vergit
        
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Full usage::
        
            vergit [-h] [--format {long,short,default,json}] [path]
        
        The ``path`` can be omitted and defaults to the current directory.
        
        There are several different formats which can be used:
        
        * ``long`` Always include the git revision info.
        * ``short`` Never include the git revision info.
        * ``default`` Hide the git revision info unless the current release is a
          pre-release or there are additional commits after the release.
        * ``json`` Output JSON data describing the version, in the form:
        
        .. code-block:: json
        
           {
             "version": "1.0.0",
             "git": "+git-0-123abcd",
             "gitn": "0",
             "gitsha": "123abcd",
             "pre_release": true
           }
