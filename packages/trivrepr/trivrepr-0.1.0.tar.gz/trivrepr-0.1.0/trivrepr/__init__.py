""" Helper module for constructing repr() strings.

The trivrepr module contains the TrivialRepr class that may be
derived from to provide an implementation of __repr__() for
simple classes that have all their attributes passed directly to
the constructor.

    import trivrepr

    class KeyValue(trivrepr.TrivialRepr):
        def __init__(self, key, value, more='hi'):
            super(KeyValue, self).__init__()
            self.key = key
            self.value = value
            self.more = more

    kv = KeyValue(key='key', value='val')
    print(repr(kv))

This program will output:

    KeyValue(key='key', value='val', more='hi')

The trivrepr module is fully typed. """
