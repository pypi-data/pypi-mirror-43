Updated versions will be made available for download from that site, as well

I'm happy to receive any bug reports, suggestions, patches, questions and so
on at <matthew@woodcraft.me.uk>.

I'm particularly interested in hearing about any |gtp| engines (even buggy
ones) which don't work with the ringmaster.

There is also a Github repository at https://github.com/mattheww/gomill.
