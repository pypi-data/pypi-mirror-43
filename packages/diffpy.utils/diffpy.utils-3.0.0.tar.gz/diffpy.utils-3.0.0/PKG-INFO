        diffpy.utils
        ========================================================================
        
        General purpose shared utilities for the diffpy libraries.
        
        The diffpy.utils package provides functions for extracting array data from
        variously formatted text files and wx GUI utilities used by the PDFgui
        program.  The package also includes an interpolation function based on the
        Whittaker-Shannon formula that can be used to resample a PDF or other profile
        function over a new grid.
        
        For more information about the diffpy.utils library, see the users manual at
        http://diffpy.github.io/diffpy.utils.
        
        
        REQUIREMENTS
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        The diffpy.utils package requires Python 3.4 or later or 2.7 and
        the following software:
        
        * ``setuptools``   - tools for installing Python packages
        * ``NumPy``        - library for scientific computing with Python
        
        The functions in diffpy.utils.wx module require
        
        * ``wxPython``     - GUI toolkit for the Python language
        
        We recommend to use `Anaconda Python <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_
        as it allows to install the software dependencies together with
        diffpy.utils.  For other Python distributions it is necessary to install
        the required software separately.  As an example, on Ubuntu Linux the
        required software can be installed with ::
        
           sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-numpy
        
        
        INSTALLATION
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        The preferred method is to use Anaconda Python and install from the
        "diffpy" channel of Anaconda packages ::
        
           conda config --add channels diffpy
           conda install diffpy.utils
        
        Another option is to use ``easy_install`` to download and install the
        latest release from `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org>`_ ::
        
           easy_install diffpy.utils
        
        If you prefer to install from sources, obtain the source archive and
        run ::
        
           python setup.py install
        
        You may need to use ``sudo`` with system Python as it attempts to
        install to standard system directories.  If sudo is not available, check
        the usage info from ``python setup.py install --help`` for options to
        install to user-writable locations.  The installation integrity can be
        verified by changing to the HOME directory and running ::
        
           python -m diffpy.utils.tests.run
        
        
        DEVELOPMENT
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        diffpy.utils is an open-source software developed as a part of the
        DiffPy-CMI complex modeling initiative at the Brookhaven National
        Laboratory.  The diffpy.utils sources are hosted at
        https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.utils.
        
        Feel free to fork the project and contribute.  To install diffpy.utils
        in a development mode, with its sources being directly used by Python
        rather than copied to a package directory, use ::
        
           python setup.py develop --user
