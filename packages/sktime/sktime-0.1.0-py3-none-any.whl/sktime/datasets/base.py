    '''Loads the gunpoint dataset as a pandas DataFrame

    This dataset involves one female actor and one male actor making a
    motion with their hand. The two classes are: Gun-Draw and Point:
    For Gun-Draw the actors have their hands by their sides. They draw
    a replicate gun from a hip-mounted holster, point it at a target
    for approximately one second, then return the gun to the holster,
    and their hands to their sides. For Point the actors have their gun
    by their sides. They point with their index fingers to a target for
    approximately one second, and then return their hands to their
    sides. For both classes, we tracked the centroid of the actor's
    right hands in both X- and Y-axes, which appear to be highly
    correlated. The data in the archive is just the X-axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    split       : string (either "TRAIN" or "TEST"
        takes the default value "TRAIN". Used to specify the appropriate
        part of the dataset to be loaded.
    return_X_y  : bool
        If True, returns the features and target separately, each as pd.Series
        If False, returns both features and target in one DataFrame

    X       : A pandas Series containing the time-series features

    The arrowhead data consists of outlines of the images of arrowheads. The shapes of the
    projectile points are converted into a time series using the angle-based method. The
    classification of projectile points is an important topic in anthropology. The classes
    are based on shape distinctions such as the presence and location of a notch in the
    arrow. The problem in the repository is a length normalised version of that used in
    Ye09shapelets. The three classes are called "Avonlea", "Clovis" and "Mix"."
