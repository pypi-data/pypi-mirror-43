# Retrospective

## Organization of the work, technologies
We have a team of 4 people, using Python 3.6. We have tree mostly-coding guys, a guy for looking for resourses, communication, documentation and testing stuff.

## Difficulties
1. Time division. We could have been with time more efficient.
2. Approach. We selected the hard way, bottom-up approach. Regardless lots of available information and sources we decided not to use ready-made solutions founded on github.
3. Knowledge. For us it was a first-time creating a network application, so we faced quite a lot of concepts understanding difficulties. 

## Lessons we learned
1. The most productive way to work for our team - take 5 or 6 full days, from morning till evening.
2. Make tasks smaller, like really small.
3. First try to build a working app, then scale it. (In our case we begin to implement advanced concepts without stable background)
4. Test more, spend more time on testing and debugging.
5. Try to be more strict with code quality.

## What would we keep for next time
1. Atmosphere. Our team has good relationship, we don't argue, always come up with solutions and take care of opinion of each member, try to give constractive critisism.
2. Approach to organize resourses links (as exel woth short explanations).
4. We tried to figure out on our own as much as we could.

## What should we do differently
1. Planning, we should be more strict with deadlines and intermidiate goals.
2. Testing, do testing simultaniously while writing code.
3. Learn more about debuging systems (not to use prints everywhere..).

## General organization changes
1. For more efficient organisation we would like to receive the deadlines as soon as possible. 
2. It could be good to have intermidiate deadline(before holidays) to show at leas somehow working application and be able to ha e Q&A session.
