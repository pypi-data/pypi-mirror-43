Description: $NNGA
        ========
        
        A neural networks combine genetic algorithm module.
        
        
        Look how easy it is to use:
        ------------------------------
        
            import neuralNetworkGA
        
            # Init algorithm
            
            ai = NeuroGA(4,[30],1) 
            
            # Get networks
            
            gen = ai.next_gen_networks() 
            
            # Input values then calculate with neural network, return result.
            
            res = gen[i].put_inputs(inputs)
            
            # Use score to mark a network to value this network bad or good.
            
            ai.mark_score(score,gen[i])
            
            # Save result
            
            savenet(gen[i],1)
            
            # Load result
            
            geni = loadnet('gen_1')
            
            res = geni.put_inputs(observation) ...
           	
        
         
        Features
        --------
        
        - You do not have to know the algorithm.
        - Make things faster
        - Use the GA to train games of yourself.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install NNGA by running:
        
            pip install NNGA
