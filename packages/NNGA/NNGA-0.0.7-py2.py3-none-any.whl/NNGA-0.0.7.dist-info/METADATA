$NNGA
========

A neural networks combine genetic algorithm module.


Look how easy it is to use:
------------------------------

    import neuralNetworkGA

    # Init algorithm

    ai = NeuroGA(4,[30],1) 

    # Get networks

    gen = ai.next_gen_networks() 

    # Input values then calculate with neural network, return result.

    res = gen[i].put_inputs(inputs)

    # Use score to mark a network to value this network bad or good.

    ai.mark_score(score,gen[i])

    # Save result

    savenet(gen[i],1)

    # Load result

    geni = loadnet('gen_1')

    res = geni.put_inputs(observation) ...
