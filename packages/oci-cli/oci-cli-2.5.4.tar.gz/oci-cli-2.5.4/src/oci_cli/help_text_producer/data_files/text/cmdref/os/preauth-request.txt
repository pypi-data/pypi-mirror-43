preauth-request
***************


Description
===========

Pre-authenticated requests provide a way to let users access a bucket
or an object without having their own credentials. When you create a
pre-authenticated request, a unique URL is generated. Users in your
organization, partners, or third parties can use this URL to access
the targets identified in the pre-authenticated request. See Managing
Access to Buckets and Objects.

To use any of the API operations, you must be authorized in an IAM
policy. If you're not authorized, talk to an administrator. If you're
an administrator who needs to write policies to give users access, see
Getting Started with Policies.
