.SH OPTIONS
.SS \-\-steering\-policy\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the target steering policy. [required]
.SS \-\-display\-name [text]
.sp
A user\-friendly name for the steering policy. Does not have to be unique, and it\(aqs changeable. Avoid entering confidential information.
.SS \-\-ttl [integer]
.sp
The Time To Live for responses from the steering policy, in seconds. If not specified during creation, a value of 30 seconds will be used.
.SS \-\-health\-check\-monitor\-id [text]
.sp
The OCID of the health check monitor providing health data about the answers of the steering policy. A steering policy answer with \fIrdata\fP matching a monitored endpoint will use the health data of that endpoint. A steering policy answer with \fIrdata\fP not matching any monitored endpoint will be assumed healthy.
.SS \-\-template [FAILOVER|LOAD_BALANCE|ROUTE_BY_GEO|ROUTE_BY_ASN|ROUTE_BY_IP|CUSTOM]
.sp
The common pattern (or lack thereof) to which the steering policy adheres. This value restricts the possible configurations of rules, but thereby supports specifically tailored interfaces. Values other than "CUSTOM" require the rules to begin with an unconditional FILTER that keeps answers contingent upon \fIanswer.isDisabled != true\fP, followed _if and only if the policy references a health check 
.nf
monitor_
.fi
 by an unconditional HEALTH rule, and require the last rule to be an unconditional LIMIT. What must precede the LIMIT rule is determined by the template value: \- FAILOVER requires exactly an unconditional PRIORITY rule that ranks answers by pool.   Each answer pool must have a unique priority value assigned to it. Answer data must   be defined in the \fIdefaultAnswerData\fP property for the rule and the \fIcases\fP property   must not be defined. \- LOAD_BALANCE requires exactly an unconditional WEIGHTED rule that shuffles answers   by name. Answer data must be defined in the \fIdefaultAnswerData\fP property for the   rule and the \fIcases\fP property must not be defined. \- ROUTE_BY_GEO requires exactly one PRIORITY rule that ranks answers by pool using the   geographical location of the client as a condition. Within that rule you may only   use \fIquery.client.geoKey\fP in the \fIcaseCondition\fP expressions for defining the cases.   For each case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool must have a unique priority   value assigned to it. Answer data can only be defined within cases and   \fIdefaultAnswerData\fP cannot be used in the PRIORITY rule. \- ROUTE_BY_ASN requires exactly one PRIORITY rule that ranks answers by pool using the   ASN of the client as a condition. Within that rule you may only use   \fIquery.client.asn\fP in the \fIcaseCondition\fP expressions for defining the cases.   For each case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool must have a unique priority   value assigned to it. Answer data can only be defined within cases and   \fIdefaultAnswerData\fP cannot be used in the PRIORITY rule. \- ROUTE_BY_IP requires exactly one PRIORITY rule that ranks answers by pool using the   IP subnet of the client as a condition. Within that rule you may only use   \fIquery.client.address\fP in the \fIcaseCondition\fP expressions for defining the cases.   For each case in the PRIORITY rule each answer pool must have a unique priority   value assigned to it. Answer data can only be defined within cases and   \fIdefaultAnswerData\fP cannot be used in the PRIORITY rule. \- CUSTOM allows an arbitrary configuration of rules.
.sp
For an existing steering policy, the template value may be changed to any of the supported options but the resulting policy must conform to the requirements for the new template type or else a Bad Request error will be returned.
.SS \-\-freeform\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Simple key\-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type, or scope. For more information, see \fI\%Resource Tags\fP <\fBhttps://docs.cloud.oracle.com/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm\fP>\&. Example: \fI{"bar\-key": "value"}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-defined\-tags [complex type]
.sp
Usage of predefined tag keys. These predefined keys are scoped to a namespace. Example: \fI{"foo\-namespace": {"bar\-key": "value"}}\fP
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-answers [complex type]
.sp
The set of all answers that can potentially issue from the steering policy.
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type SteeringPolicyAnswer.  For documentation on SteeringPolicyAnswer please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/datatypes/SteeringPolicyAnswer\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-param\-json\-input option can be used to generate an example of the JSON which must be provided. We recommend storing this example
in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-rules [complex type]
.sp
The pipeline of rules that will be processed in sequence to reduce the pool of answers to a response for any given request.
.sp
The first rule receives a shuffled list of all answers, and every other rule receives the list of answers emitted by the one preceding it. The last rule populates the response.
.sp
This option is a JSON list with items of type SteeringPolicyRule.  For documentation on SteeringPolicyRule please see our API reference: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/api/#/en/dns/20180115/datatypes/SteeringPolicyRule\fP\&.
This is a complex type whose value must be valid JSON. The value can be provided as a string on the command line or passed in as a file using
the \fI\%file://path/to/file\fP syntax.
.sp

in a file, modifying it as needed and then passing it back in via the \fI\%file://\fP syntax.
.SS \-\-if\-match [text]
.sp
The \fIIf\-Match\fP header field makes the request method conditional on the existence of at least one current representation of the target resource, when the field\-value is \fI*\fP, or having a current representation of the target resource that has an entity\-tag matching a member of the list of entity\-tags provided in the field\-value.
.SS \-\-if\-unmodified\-since [text]
.sp
The \fIIf\-Unmodified\-Since\fP header field makes the request method conditional on the selected representation\(aqs last modification date being earlier than or equal to the date provided in the field\-value.  This field accomplishes the same purpose as If\-Match for cases where the user agent does not have an entity\-tag for the representation.
.SS \-\-force
.sp
Perform update without prompting for confirmation.
.SS \-\-wait\-for\-state [ACTIVE|CREATING|DELETED|DELETING]
.sp
This operation creates, modifies or deletes a resource that has a defined lifecycle state. Specify this option to perform the action and then wait until the resource reaches a given lifecycle state. If timeout is reached, a return code of 2 is returned. For any other error, a return code of 1 is returned.
.SS \-\-max\-wait\-seconds [integer]
.sp
The maximum time to wait for the resource to reach the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 1200 seconds.
.SS \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds [integer]
.sp
Check every \-\-wait\-interval\-seconds to see whether the resource to see if it has reached the lifecycle state defined by \-\-wait\-for\-state. Defaults to 30 seconds.
.SS \-\-from\-json [text]
.sp
Provide input to this command as a JSON document from a file using the \fI\%file://path\-to/file\fP syntax.
.sp
The \-\-generate\-full\-command\-json\-input option can be used to generate a sample json file to be used with this command option. The key names are pre\-populated and match the command option names (converted to camelCase format, e.g. compartment\-id \-\-> compartmentId), while the values of the keys need to be populated by the user before using the sample file as an input to this command. For any command option that accepts multiple values, the value of the key can be a JSON array.
.sp
Options can still be provided on the command line. If an option exists in both the JSON document and the command line then the command line specified value will be used.
.sp
For examples on usage of this option, please see our "using CLI with advanced JSON options" link: \fI\%https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliusing.htm#AdvancedJSONOptions\fP
