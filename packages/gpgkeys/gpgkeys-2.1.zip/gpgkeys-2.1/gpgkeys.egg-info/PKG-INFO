        ---------------------
        A GnuPG Shell
        ---------------------
        
        Overview
        ============
        
        **gpgkeys** is a Python program that allows to conveniently manage GnuPG_ keys
        and keyrings from the command line.
        It comes in the form of a shell, with commands resembling GnuPG CLI commands and
        their options.
        Its main feature is end-to-end tab completion.
        
        gpgkeys also serves as testbed for the development of the kmd_ and rl_ Python
        libraries.

        Motivation
        ==========
        
        The GnuPG CLI is very powerful â€“ and with great power comes
        great incomprehensibility.
        
        gpgkeys makes key management easy by:
        
        1. Providing a sensible subset of GnuPG commands, and
        2. Using tab completion to streamline the input process and
           guide the user through key management tasks.
        
        Example Session
        ===============
        
        Everything in gpgkeys can be tab completed: commands, help topics, option flags,
        key ids, user names, file names, shell commands, and keyserver URLs.
        ::
        
            $ gpgkeys
            gpgkeys 1.24 (type help for help)
        
            gpgkeys> help
        
            Available commands (type help <topic>):
            =======================================
            EOF       del   export  genkey     import   lsign  refresh  shell
            checksig  dump  fdump   genrevoke  list     quit   search   sign
            clear     edit  fetch   help       listsig  recv   send     version
        
            Shortcut commands (type help <topic>):
            ======================================
            !  .  ?  e  ll  ls
        
            gpgkeys> help export
            Usage: export <keyspec>
            Options: --armor --clean --minimal --output --secret
        
            Export keys to stdout or to a file
        
            gpgkeys> ls Stefan
            pub   1024R/E1F438AD 1995-10-03
            uid                  Stefan H. Holek (RSA) <stefan@epy.co.at>
        
            pub   1024D/355A2D28 2001-11-04
            uid                  Stefan H. Holek <stefan@epy.co.at>
            sub   2048g/A27E0DBC 2004-10-27
        
            gpgkeys> export --armor 355A2D28 > stefan.asc
            gpgkeys> .ls
            alice.asc             stefan.asc
        
        Features
        ============
        
        The order of options and arguments on the command line is not important::
        
            gpgkeys> export 355A2D28 --armor > stefan.asc
        
        Command lines prefixed with '.' or '!' are executed by the shell.
        You can use ``cd`` to change the current directory,
        ``umask`` to change the umask, and of course everything else::
        
            gpgkeys> .cd subdir/
            gpgkeys> .pwd
            /home/stefan/subdir
        
        You can use input/output redirects and pipes::
        
            gpgkeys> export 355A2D28 | pgpdump | less
        
        To see the commands sent to GnuPG, run gpgkeys with the
        ``-v`` option::
        
            $ gpgkeys -v
            gpgkeys 1.24 (type help for help)
        
            gpgkeys> ls 355A2D28
            gpgkeys: gpg --list-keys 355A2D28
            pub   1024D/355A2D28 2001-11-04
            uid                  Stefan H. Holek <stefan@epy.co.at>
            sub   2048g/A27E0DBC 2004-10-27
        
        For everything you ever wanted to know about GnuPG commands, type::
        
            gpgkeys> .man gpg
        
        gpgkeys can be invoked with arguments, in which case it does not enter
        the command loop::
        
            $ gpgkeys export --armor 355A2D28 > stefan.asc
        
        Keyservers
        ==========
        
        For the send, recv, search, and refresh commands to work, at least one
        keyserver should be configured in gpg.conf. For example::
        
            keyserver ldap://keyserver.pgp.com
            keyserver hkps://hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
        
        The last keyserver in gpg.conf becomes the default keyserver.
        All keyservers become available for completion after the ``--keyserver`` option.
        
        Unicode
        =======
        
        OpenPGP allows user IDs to be either Latin-1 or UTF-8 encoded.
        To find keys with non-ASCII IDs, GnuPG requires search strings to be
        encoded the right way.
        
        gpgkeys' key completion keeps track of the original encodings, and every name
        you tab-complete will automatically be encoded the way GnuPG expects.
        You may sometimes see '?' characters in place of non-ASCII characters on the
        command line, which are a result of the above and no reason for concern.
        
        Development
        ===========
        
        gpgkeys development is hosted on GitHub_. It also has an `issue tracker`_ there.
        
        .. _GitHub: https://github.com/stefanholek/gpgkeys
        .. _`issue tracker`: https://github.com/stefanholek/gpgkeys/issues
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation requires Python 2.7 or higher.
        
        gpgkeys depends on kmd_, which in turn uses the rl_ library. Since rl
        contains a C extension, it is a good idea to review its `installation
        instructions`_ and make sure all dependencies are in place.
        
        To install the ``gpgkeys`` script, type::
        
            pip install gpgkeys
        
        .. _`installation instructions`: https://github.com/stefanholek/rl#installation
        
        Then put it on your system PATH by e.g. symlinking it to ``/usr/local/bin``.
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        Either the ``gpg2`` command or the ``gpg`` command must be available on the
        system PATH.

        1.7.1 - 2010-02-13
        ------------------
        
        - Depend on rl >= 1.4.1 explicitly so setuptools does not forget to upgrade
          it as well.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.7 - 2010-02-13
        ----------------
        
        - Change license to GPL.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.6 - 2010-01-31

        - Add --clean and --minimal import/export options to respective commands.
          [stefan]
        
        - Fix --merge-only import option of keyserver commands.

          [stefan]
        
        
        1.5 - 2010-01-26
        ----------------
        
        - Remove obsolete --secret option from the import command.
          [stefan]
        
        - Userid completion is now triggered by any kind of quoting.
          [stefan]
        
        - Allow to specifiy command line options after the argument.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.4 - 2010-01-20
        ----------------
        
        - Extend the quoting and dequoting API to make it more (re)usable.
          [stefan]
        
        - Dequoting didn't work right when the default quoting character
          was single quote.
          [stefan]
        
        - Tildes in quoted filenames could cause quotes to be closed even
          if the tilde-expanded name matched a directory.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.3 - 2010-01-03
        ----------------
        
        - Cut down on infrastructure slack in filename completion. The
          individual strategies are very small.
          [stefan]
        
        - Remove logging as it clutters up the code.
          [stefan]
        
        - Add an example session to the README.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.2 - 2009-11-24
        ----------------
        
        - Extend keyid completion to also complete userids and names.
          [stefan]
        
        - Extract filename completion functionality into functions,
          as it is useful in other places as well.
          [stefan]
        
        
        1.1 - 2009-11-16
        ----------------
        
        - Allow to specify the filename quoting style on the command line
          to ease experimentation.
          [stefan]
        
        - Filename completion: By dequoting early on we can skip a problematic
          hook and regain control over tilde expansion. Also see rl `issue/3`_.

        1.0 - 2009-11-08
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
