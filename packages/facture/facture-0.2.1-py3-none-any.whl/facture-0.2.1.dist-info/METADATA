Facture provides developers with a sensible base structure and set of tools for 
building *performant*, *lightweight* and *scalable* HTTP API packages that can
be easily deployed, combined - or shared with others.  

Check out a demo of the Facture REST API browser over at [https://demo.facture.dev](https://demo.facture.dev).

It's built on top of [aiohttp](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp), is compatible with its plugin system, 
and uses the *blazing fast* [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) implementation of the asyncio event loop.

Features and limitations:
- Delivers performance and concurrency
- Scales horizontally
- Comes with a REST API browser
- Supports CORS and JWT out of the box
- Has built-in support for [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org) databases
- Provides intuitive tools for object serialization
- Created with [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) in mind
- Works only with modern versions of Python (3.6+)
- Event loop driven; code must be [asynchronous](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)

Getting started

Development
---
While Facture does work, it's currently under heavy development; Expect some breakage, as well as lacking documentation and tests.
That being said - I would very much appreciate people testing out the software, and perhaps even contribute with code.
