        elm-fluent is a `Fluent <https://projectfluent.org/>`_ implementation for Elm.
        
        Fluent is a next-generation translation/localization solution, designed by the
        folks at Mozilla, based on many years of experience with localizing into a large
        number of different languages. Mozilla have extracted parts of their 'l20n'
        solution (used by apps like Firefox and Thunderbird) into a re-usable
        specification designed specifically for the web.
        
        elm-fluent is a full implementation of this specification for Elm (currently
        supporting the Fluent 0.8 syntax).
        
        It operates as a command line tool that compiles ``.ftl`` files to ``.elm``
        files. The result is that each message becomes a function that will generate a
        translated string (or HTML fragment) for a given locale and an optional set of
        strongly typed parameters (string, dates or numbers).
        
        Dates and numbers can also be passed with formatting parameters supplied - for
        example, to attach a currency to a number, so that it can be correctly formatted
        as a currency according to the rules of the locale in use.
        
        Please see the `docs
        <https://elm-fluent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more
        information.

        ------------------
        
        * Fixed python-fluent dependency to an older version (< 0.9), because it
