## FAQ

#### Q: How does it work?
We determine the inputs and outputs for each cell by building an
[AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) of your code. Each new
cell execution creates a new leaf which is attached in the tree where the
most recent change in the new leaf's inputs occured as an output to a prior
cell.
