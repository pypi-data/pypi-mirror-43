Description: # Wagtail Events [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/thclark/wagtail_events.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/thclark/wagtail_events)
        
        Events calendar management for wagtail, with tools for filtering by date.
        
        This project is a hard fork of [omni-wagtail-events](http://github.com/omni-digital-omni-wagtail-events), and we owe a
        debt of gratitude to those folks for getting us started. So why did I hard-fork (duplicate and start again) rather than
        fork from omni-digital?
        
        Well, github keeps the releases of the repo you fork from. Since I want to put this on pypi so it's easily available,
        and have control of the release versioning, it needs to be here. Plus, I'm basically about to break *everything* for 
        django 2.x and wagtail 2.x, so figured that the chances of getting my changes merged into the upstream were nil anyway.
        
        I'm extremely open to collaboration - in fact, I really don't want to be maintaining this (it's only for one client) so
        I'm open to transferring ownership or collaboration to anyone who wants to take this on and enhance it. @omni-digital,
        this originated as your baby so if you'd like to take back maintenance, please reach out and I'll help you.
