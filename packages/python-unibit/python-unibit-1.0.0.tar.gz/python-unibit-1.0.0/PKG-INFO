Description: # unibit
        
        *A Python module to get stock data and news from the UniBit API*
        
        UniBit is a free API that provides real time and historical financial data, as well as financial news. This SDK is a client-side implementation of the UniBit API (https://www.unibit.ai) which has Python functions for each available API call. For the UniBit API documentation, visit (https://unibit.ai/docs)
        
        To get started, sign up at (https://unibit.ai/login) to request a free access key. With a free key, all non-news API features are available with generous rate limits.
        
        The UniBit Stock News API requires a premium account, but in return gives a wealth of news articles on all 8000 US-listed companies. Along with this, UniBit provides analyses on each news article. With deep learning, each article is classified into a comprehensive genre list, and named entities and sentiment are also extracted.
