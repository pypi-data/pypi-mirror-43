Contributing
============

We appreciate your contributions! Because this is an open source project, we want to keep it as easy
as possible to contribute changes. However, we need contributors to follow a few guidelines.

## Contributor agreement

## Process

Please create a pull request in GitHub with your
contribution. Before creating the pull request, please ensure that all tests pass. We also run the
tests on a wide range of boards for every pull request using our CI setup. Changes must pass on
all tested boards before the the pull request can be merged.

The [developers' guide](docs/DEVELOPERS_GUIDE.md) describes how to create your development environment.
The [automated tests guide](docs/AUTOMATED_TESTS.md) provides information about the available types
of tests and describes how to run the tests.
