# qtasktimer

This is a simple timer for timeboxing, Pomodoro Technique, etc. that runs in
systray. It's written in Python and uses PyQt5.

## Installation

    $ pip install qtasktimer

## Usage

    $ qtt

This will start the app and the icon will appear in systray. Left-click on it
to start a 25 minute timer or right-click to open a menu with more options.

This is how it looks more or less in the middle of a pomodoro:
