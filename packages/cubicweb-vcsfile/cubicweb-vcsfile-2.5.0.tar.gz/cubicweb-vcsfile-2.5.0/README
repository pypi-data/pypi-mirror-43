Summary
-------

This cube stores the data found in a version content manager
repository. It currently works with mercurial repositories.

The revision metadata (parents, author, description, etc) is stored in
entities, and thus accessible from RQL, but the files and contents are
read from the VCS on demand.

Notice this cube depends on mercurial's `evolve extension`_. If you install
vcsfile using a Debian package, you'll probably have to add Logilab's backport
repository to find the `mercurial-evolve` package, e.g. ::

  deb  http://download.logilab.org/backports/dists/ jessie/

On other system, you're on your own.
