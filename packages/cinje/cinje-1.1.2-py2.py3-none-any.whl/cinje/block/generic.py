	"""Block-level passthrough.  Blocks must be terminated by ": end" markers.
	
	Support is included for chains of blocks of the expected types, without requiring ": end" markers between them.
	
	This block-level transformer handles: "if", "elif", and "else" conditional scopes; "while" and "for" loops,
	including the optional "else" clause to "for"; "with" context managers; and the exception management machinery of
	"try", "except", "finally", and "else".  (Any given intermediary component is optional, of course.)
