Description: # django-cmsplugin-alerts
        
        ## What does it do?
        
        Adds a alert/notification subscription option to the cms toolbar and then
        sends an alert to any subscribed user using the django-notification alerts
        package.
        
        This requires that you're already using the `django-boxed-alerts` package in
        your project.
        
        Will optionally combine with `cmsplugin-diff` to to add more information to the
        emails and notification messages sent out. This package is designed to be used
        with this extra information.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install cmsplugin-alerts
        ```
        
        Add the plugin to your site's settings.py::
        
        ```
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
          ...
          'alerts',
          'cmsplugin_diff',
          'cmsplugin_alerts',
          ...
        )
        ```
