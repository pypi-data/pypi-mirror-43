Description: # Oversteer - Steering Wheel Manager for Linux
        
        https://github.com/berarma/oversteer
        
        Graphical application to configure Logitech Wheels.
        
        Features supported:
         - Setting the emulation mode.
         - Setting the rotation range.
         - Combine pedals for games that use just one axis for gas/brake.
        
        This software uses the Linux driver for Logitech HID++ devices and thus it
        could work on any model supported by said driver.
        
        It's only been tested on the Logitech G29 Driving Force. It could work on other
        models but it's untested.
        
        Please, use at your own risk. Suggestions, bugs and pull requests welcome.
        
        ## Installation
        
        For now, it lacks a convenient installation method.
        
        Download this repository and run ```./oversteer.py```.
        
        ### Dependencies
        
        There's some required Python dependencies. Please, install the following
        Python3 packages in case they're not installed already:
        
         - gi
         - pyudev
         - xdg
        
        ```jstest-gtk``` is launched when the test button is clicked.
        
        On Debian derived distros you can use the following command to install them:
        
        ```apt install python3 python3-gi python3-pyudev python3-xdg jstest-gtk```
        
        Other distros may use slightly different names for the same packages.
        
        ### Permissions
        
        The app will ask for an administrator password if it doesn't have permissions
        to write to the device driver.
        
        You can make the driver files writable by anyone using udev rules. It will
        allow using this app without administrator privileges and also make some driver
        features available to games.
        
        Install the udev rules file:
        
        ```cp udev/99-logitech-wheel-perms.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/```
        
        Reload udev rules (or reboot your computer):
        
        ```sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger```
        
        The changes will take effect next time the device is plugged.
