Start application by running main_application.py

GUI based steel structure calculation tool.
 
 The following is calculated:
  - Minimum plate thickness (DNVGL-OS-C101)
  - Minimum section modulus of stiffener/plate (DNVGL-OS-C101)
  - Minimum shear area (DNVGL-OS-C101)
  - Buckling (DNVGL-RP-C201)
  - Fatigue for plate/stiffener connection (DNVGL-RP-C203)

Compartments (tank pressures) are created automatically.

Pressures on external hull (or any other generic location) is defined by specifying equations.

You can optimize single plate/stiffener field or multiple.

PLEASE CONTRIBUTE. 
For windows executable (.exe) version for non-coders, use the link below. Unzip and click the .exe file. Same licenese.
Note that I am looking for contributions. Non-coders can verify, make documentation, suggest improvements etc. Point
is: please do more than just use the tool and stay silent :)
