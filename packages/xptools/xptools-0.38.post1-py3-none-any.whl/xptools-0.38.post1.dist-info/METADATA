# xptools

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/xptools.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/xptools)

Analysis tools for experimental sciences to display images, detect particles (cells, bubbles, crystals), moving fronts and analyze their shape, size and distibution.

## Installation

xptools is on PyPI so you can install it straight from pip with the command

```
pip install xptools
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository to your local computer and install from source

```
git clone https://github.com/hlgirard/xptools
cd xptools
pip install .
```

## Scripts

- analyze_front - This scipt takes a directory containing video files. For each file, it asks the user to select a region of interest
and processes the selected area with a minimum threshold to find the largest area. It then plots the height of this area as
a function of time.

```
analyze_front --plotly --scale 60 --framerate 30 moviedirectory/
```

- analyze_bubbles - This script takes a movie (or directory of movies) showing bubbles on a surface (bright on dark). It uses a watershed segmentation algorithm to identify the bubbles and characterize their size. It then plots the bubble density and mean size as a function of time.

```
analyze_bubbles --plotly --scale 60 bubble_movie.avi
```

- analyze_crystals - This script takes a directory containing pictures of droplets containing crystals (under cross polarization). It uses a thresholding algorithm to segment the crystals, count them and measure their size.

```
analyze_crystals --plotly --key funct_key.txt imagedirectory/
```

- display_image_matrix - Arranges all the images in a directory as a matrix and saves the resulting image

```
display_image_matrix --lines 10 --compress imagedirectory/
```

## Utilities

Several utilities are included in the submodule utils including:

- select_roi:select_rectangle - Prompts the user to make a rectangular selection on the passed image and returns the coordinates of the selection.

- videotools:open_video - Opens a video file as a list of np.arrays each containing one frame of the video.

- videotools:determine_threshold - Determines the threshold to use for a video based on the minimum threshold algorithm.

- videotools:obtain_cropping_boxes - Prompts the user to select the region of interest for each video file. Returns a dataframe containing the coordinates of the selected area for each file.

- imagetools:open_all_images - Opens all the images in a folder and returns a list of cv2 images.

### Example usage

```python
import pandas as pd
from xptools.utils import videotools

video_list = ['Film1.avi','Film2.avi']

dict_crop = videotools.obtain_cropping_boxes(video_list)

for key, val in dict_crop:
    stack = videotools.open_video(key)
    (minRow, minCol, maxRow, maxCol) = val
    stack = [img[minRow:maxRow,minCol:maxCol] for img in stack]
    process(stack)
```

## Notebooks

- SegmentationBroadSpectrum.ipynb - Tests different image segmentation techniques to determine which is most appropriate
- SegmentationFocused.ipynb - Implements a specific analysis and plots the resulting size and number distributions for the particles
- Watershed_Segmentation.ipynb - Implements Watershed segmentation.
