        glomex-cloud-deployment-tools (gcdt)
        ====================================
        
        gcdt CLI tools make it easy for you to code, automate, and deploy your
        AWS infrastructure.
        
        The gcdt command line tools have emerged from our experiences at glomex
        while working extensively with AWS services like Cloudformation,
        CodeDeploy, AWS Lambda, and API Gateway. gcdt is based on the same
        technology AWS uses to build AWS-CLI and Boto3 tools.
        
        In 2017 glomex won the Gartner award "Best Data Management and
        Infrastructure". Key to our success are the gcdt CLI tools we use to
        successfully complete >3000 deployments per month to AWS. Over the
        course of the last 18 months we built gcdt ourselves using Python.
        
        |Gartner Award|
        
        Features include:
        
        -  Infrastructure-as-code
        -  Cloud infrastructure (kumo & tenkai)
        -  Serverless infrastructure (ramuda & yugen)
        -  Scaffolding
        -  Powerful plugin mechanism
        -  Service integration (Slack, Datadog, ...)
        -  Codify infrastructure best practices
        -  Multi-Env support (dev, stage, prod, ...)
        
        At glomex we love ``continuous-integration-as-code`` and
        ``infrastructure-as-code``. This enables us to move fast while providing
        services of high quality and resilience to our partners.
        
        We added a plugin mechanism to gcdt so we can specialize gcdt to highly
        optimized and opinionated environments that resonate with our usecases.
        
        We hope gcdt will be helpful to you, too. At glomex we believe that only
        open source software can become truly great software.
        
        Why gcdt?
        ---------
        
        You can do everything gcdt does by using the AWS Management Console so
        why use gcdt? Basically, because using GUI interfaces to drive your
        production environment is a really bad idea. You can't really automate
        GUI interfaces, you can't debug GUI interfaces, and you can't easily
        share techniques and best practices with a GUI.
        
        The goal of gcdt is to put everything about your AWS infrastructure into
        files on a filesystem which can be easily versioned and shared. Once
        your files are in git, people on your team can create pull requests to
        merge new changes in and those pull requests can be reviewed, commented
        on, and eventually approved. This is a tried and proven approach that
        has worked for more traditional deployment methodologies and will also
        work for your infrastructure on AWS.
