def extendScriptEnv(env, extra):
    """
    extend a partially filtered environment (globals) for a run_path event

    When invoking ``run_path`` [1], a dictionary of globals is provided to
    pre-populate a script's globals before execution. Inside the releng process,
    the command ``run_path`` is invoked several times to help load settings and
    package-specific scripts. To exist in sharing releng-provided constants and
    also assisting in allow some-level of sharing user-defined constants, the
    list of globals to be populated can be extended each execution and be passed
    into a following script. Not all global options are desired to be passed.
    For example, Python magic options and referenced built-in functions. This
    method can be used to easily extend an existing dictionary of globals while
    also filtering out undesired entries output from external scripts.
