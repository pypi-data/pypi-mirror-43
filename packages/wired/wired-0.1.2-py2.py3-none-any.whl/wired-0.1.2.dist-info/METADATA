``wired`` is an implementation of an inversion-of-control (IoC) container and
may be used as the core of a dependency injection (DI) framework or simply as
a way to separate config-time from runtime for services in an application. It
also provides caching such that a container maintains a local copy of each
service as they are instantiated.

See https://wired.readthedocs.io or
``docs/index.rst`` in this distribution for detailed documentation.


0.1.2 (2019-03-23)
==================

- Add support for Python 3.7.

- Fix an issue where two different service classes with the same name would
  be treated as the same service, defeating the type-based lookup.

0.1.1 (2018-08-04)
==================

- Improve memory management slightly in cases where many short-lived context
  objects are used by tracking and cleaning up their weakrefs.

0.1 (2018-08-01)
================

- Initial release.
