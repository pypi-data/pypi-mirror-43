``wired`` is an implementation of an inversion-of-control (IoC) container and
may be used as the core of a dependency injection (DI) framework or simply as
a way to separate config-time from runtime for services in an application. It
also provides caching such that a container maintains a local copy of each
service as they are instantiated.

See https://wired.readthedocs.io or
``docs/index.rst`` in this distribution for detailed documentation.
