        ``wired`` is an implementation of an inversion-of-control (IoC) container and
        may be used as the core of a dependency injection (DI) framework or simply as
        a way to separate config-time from runtime for services in an application. It
        also provides caching such that a container maintains a local copy of each
        service as they are instantiated.

        ==================
        
        - Add support for Python 3.7.
        
        - Fix an issue where two different service classes with the same name would
          be treated as the same service, defeating the type-based lookup.

        ==================
        
        - Improve memory management slightly in cases where many short-lived context
          objects are used by tracking and cleaning up their weakrefs.
