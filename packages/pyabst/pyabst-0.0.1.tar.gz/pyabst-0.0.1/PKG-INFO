        PyAbst is a library developed to summarise text. The PyAbst algorithm ranks words according by word frequency. Each sentence is scored through summing associated word frequencies across the sentence. PyAbst allows users to amplify or suppress the weighting for specific target words. If the target word weighting is defined sufficiantly high (or low), sentences containing the target words will always be present (or absent). An interactive An interactive web-application is currently being developed and will be available shortly at [www.pyabst.com](www.pyabst.com).
